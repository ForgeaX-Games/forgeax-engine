# Physical Atmosphere validation

The sky, finite-distance aerial perspective, direct solar attenuation and captured sky lighting consume one spherical Rayleigh/Mie/ozone medium. Analytic height fog retains its authored density and the documented fixed-source approximation; transparent writers apply transport at their own depth.

The buildings/mountains are at 100 m, 1 km, 5 km and 20 km. The [42-case browser report](https://github.com/ForgeaX-Games/forgeax-engine-assets/blob/971e6531f986286cfcb906cccef04a3cf61bf0ef/evidence/2026-09-29-sky-atmosphere/data/report.json) includes dusk, clouds/shadows, fog, transparent blend modes, neutral transmission, local volume, orthographic/orbital cameras, two views, half-resolution TAAU, an explicit history reset and resize. Sky pixels remain identical when AP alone is disabled. Neutral glass has p99 zero error and maximum 1/255. All browser/GPU error lists are empty.

GPU convergence uses 1,024 rays in each of 12 altitude/sun cases, with 64-step production integration versus 512-step integration after the same exposure/ACES/sRGB output. Worst sky p95/p99 is **0.013677 / 0.021676**; AP is **0.000236 / 0.000693**, below 0.02 / 0.05. Scalar transmission fails at 0.067396 / 0.078627, so the implementation retains RGB transmission. This is numerical convergence, not a comparison against a runnable Unreal or external path-tracer golden.

## RHI Debug

[Six captured frames](https://github.com/ForgeaX-Games/forgeax-engine-assets/blob/971e6531f986286cfcb906cccef04a3cf61bf0ef/evidence/2026-09-29-sky-atmosphere/data/replay.json) each replay on a fresh native Dawn device. Five match Browser pixels exactly; volume differs by at most 1/255. Linear HDR has no nonfinite values or half-float saturation. The archived gzip tapes were independently decompressed and [replayed again](https://github.com/ForgeaX-Games/forgeax-engine-assets/blob/971e6531f986286cfcb906cccef04a3cf61bf0ef/evidence/2026-09-29-sky-atmosphere/data/archive-replay.json), preserving all hashes and results.

Deep capture analysis caught an orbital ray-reconstruction precision error and a duplicate capture-retention path. GPU ray regression covers 2 m, 65 km and 1,000 km. Changing sun and medium between probe faces now preserves the frozen result exactly, completes in 35 frames with at most one probe work item/frame, and performs 126 atmosphere cube/filter passes instead of 462. Sixty stationary frames add no bake. See [probe evidence](https://github.com/ForgeaX-Games/forgeax-engine-assets/blob/971e6531f986286cfcb906cccef04a3cf61bf0ef/evidence/2026-09-29-sky-atmosphere/data/probe.json) and [Browser/Dawn pair](https://github.com/ForgeaX-Games/forgeax-engine-assets/blob/971e6531f986286cfcb906cccef04a3cf61bf0ef/evidence/2026-09-29-sky-atmosphere/images/probe-compare.png).

## Performance and boundaries

M4 Pro / 12 CPU cores / 64 GiB, Chrome 154 / Metal; AA off, 60 warm-up frames and 120 samples per steady case. Values below are measured GPU spans, not sums of overlapping pass intervals or presentation latency.

| Case | 512² p95 ms | 1024² p95 ms |
|:--|--:|--:|
| Atmosphere disabled | 0.967 | 2.247 |
| Static atmosphere | 1.331 | 3.458 |
| Moving camera | 2.736 | 4.844 |
| Changing sun every frame | 10.207 | 11.887 |
| Changing medium every frame | 12.931 | 14.595 |
| Static with shadows | 1.466 | 3.960 |
| Two views | 2.361 | 4.327 |

[512² raw samples](https://github.com/ForgeaX-Games/forgeax-engine-assets/blob/971e6531f986286cfcb906cccef04a3cf61bf0ef/evidence/2026-09-29-sky-atmosphere/data/performance/report.json) and [1024² raw samples](https://github.com/ForgeaX-Games/forgeax-engine-assets/blob/971e6531f986286cfcb906cccef04a3cf61bf0ef/evidence/2026-09-29-sky-atmosphere/data/performance-1024/report.json) include CPU submission timing, per-pass timestamps and resource inspection. Continuous solar/medium edits remain expensive because lighting products rebuild. The cold-resource sample excludes shader/compiler startup.

Per-view LUT storage is 843,776 bytes; calculated imported storage is 139,264 bytes/medium, 1,381,384 bytes/sky generation and 1,496 shared buffer bytes, excluding driver alignment. Captures pin old generations through submission fences. After removing the second view, reported single-view graph allocation returns to 7,783,780 bytes with zero pending retirement. Multi-view inspection describes the selected graph; physical GPU residency and unknown-sized resources are not reported as measured totals.

Atmosphere requires compute, float storage/filtering, 3D sampling and 31 sampled-texture lanes; insufficient devices return structured unavailable. MSAA depth is excluded. Development/CI Chromium exposes actual adapter limits without changing the backend: [SwiftShader](https://github.com/ForgeaX-Games/forgeax-engine-assets/blob/971e6531f986286cfcb906cccef04a3cf61bf0ef/evidence/2026-09-29-sky-atmosphere/data/swiftshader-admission.json) reports 16 under privacy tiering, 48 without it, and successfully requests 31. Explicit minimum-capability tests remain in the roster.

The [default game](https://github.com/ForgeaX-Games/forgeax-engine-assets/blob/971e6531f986286cfcb906cccef04a3cf61bf0ef/evidence/2026-09-29-sky-atmosphere/images/game-3d.png) passes combined Engine/Render Workers, input/physics/animation, 300 frames and 60 after resize on SwiftShader. Its sun/exposure now use the physical calibration. Below-ground background rays terminate at the planet; no planet-surface mesh is generated by Atmosphere.

The authoritative full CI result is attached to the final PR commit. This static report records local measurement provenance; it does not substitute for the full Browser, Dawn and 60-frame smoke rosters.
