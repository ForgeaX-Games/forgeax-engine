# hello-bloom

> Bloom post-processing opt-in exemplar. Press Space to toggle the ten-pass declarative Bloom pipeline at runtime.

(feat-20260531-bloom-first-declarative-render-graph-pass / M4 / w18)

## What is demonstrated

- **Ten-pass declarative render graph chain**: five downsample passes -> four tent upsample passes -> Bloom composite, all in linear HDR.
- **Camera bloom columns**: `bloom`, `bloomThreshold`, `bloomIntensity`, `bloomSoftKnee`, and `bloomScatter` configured per-Camera alongside `tonemap`/`antialias`.
- **Zero-overhead default**: bloom=0 (BLOOM_DISABLED) allocates no Bloom textures, binds no Bloom pipelines, and performs no Bloom uploads or encodes.
- **Runtime toggle**: Space-key press-edge system swaps Camera.bloom between BLOOM_ENABLED and BLOOM_DISABLED via world.set. DOM HUD overlay mirrors state as text; the carrier smoke verifies on -> off -> resize -> on surface reconfiguration.
- **HDR+Reinhard pipeline**: Camera.tonemap=Reinhard-Extended enables the HDR path required by Bloom; continuous HDR extraction uses bloomThreshold (1.0) from the scene-linear target.

Game-facing imports use the public umbrella route:

```ts
import { BLOOM_ENABLED, Camera, TONEMAP_REINHARD_EXTENDED } from '@forgeax/engine/render';
```

## Run

```bash
pnpm dev                        # vite dev server -> localhost:5173
pnpm build                      # production bundle -> dist/
pnpm --filter @forgeax/hello-bloom smoke   # Dawn 60-frame lifecycle + readback
pnpm --filter @forgeax/hello-bloom smoke:odd-dawn # real HDR odd-extent oracle
pnpm --filter @forgeax/hello-bloom smoke:quality-dawn # real HDR radial/DC/intensity/motion/extent evidence
pnpm --filter @forgeax/hello-bloom smoke:performance # receipt-bound per-pass GPU timing evidence
pnpm --filter @forgeax/hello-bloom smoke:browser # Browser WebGPU lifecycle + PNG readback
pnpm --filter @forgeax/hello-bloom smoke:browser-device-loss # Browser GPU loss -> Renderer.recover()
pnpm --filter @forgeax/hello-bloom smoke:falsify # expected red Bloom contribution control
pnpm --filter @forgeax/hello-bloom smoke:all # complete Dawn + Browser carrier gate
```

Ordinary CI retains the initial 60-frame lifecycle receipt and every resize/recovery pixel check, but uses eight post-resize frames with `FORGEAX_DAWN_LIGHTWEIGHT=1` or `FORGEAX_BROWSER_CI_LIGHTWEIGHT=1`. GPU timing mode and full local runs retain sixty post-resize frames.


## Scene

An emissive sphere (baseColor=[1.0,0.85,0.55], emissive=[1.0,0.7,0.3], emissiveIntensity=2.0) on the left and a non-emissive reference cube on the right, under a slant directional light. The sphere's > 1.0 HDR pixels feed Bloom extraction; the cube stays below the threshold as a visual anchor.

## Smoke gate

`scripts/smoke-dawn.mjs` runs a real dawn-node headless smoke with at least 60
successful Renderer submits. It records the on -> off -> resize -> re-enabled
-> surface-reconfigure phases, detached Bloom inspection, graph roster, structured errors,
and `copyTextureToBuffer` readback. Between off and re-enabled it also drives
the `bloomIntensity === 0` / `BLOOM_ENABLED` exact-zero case. The contribution
oracle uses numeric RGB
readback and rejects an all-black enabled output; hashes are diagnostic only.
`smoke:falsify` removes every scene radiance source with the same camera, graph,
and frame schedule and must make that oracle fail. `smoke:odd-dawn` runs the
cooked production downsample shader against an independent CPU extraction
oracle: 100 threshold/knee/RGB/HDR cases, the odd-extent coverage cases, the
per-texel-before-average falsifier, and threshold-adjacent continuity sweeps
that reject a legacy whole-RGB switch. Its evidence records the binary16
subnormal quantum used for the unavoidable `rgba16float` near-zero absolute
error boundary; references above `2^-24 / 0.01` retain the 1% normalized gate,
while smaller positive references use one binary16 quantum as the absolute
decoded-error gate. It does not clamp the production shader or hide non-finite
values. `smoke:quality-dawn` binds the same cooked production modules for
matched-contribution `r90`, constant-field DC, tone-free intensity, alpha,
small/odd extents, and a 60-frame energy-constant subpixel trajectory whose
energy is summed over the entire D0 footprint; its radial metric is reported
in output-pixel coordinates and is accepted only when the complete D0 edge
decodes to zero. The motion trajectory uses the same full-D0 boundary rule;
its PNG files are viewed evidence only. `smoke:performance` opts into the existing
Renderer receipt-bound timestamp route and fails closed if 60 stable Bloom
frames cannot produce complete ten-pass timing facts, or if the active Bloom
resource signature drifts during the sample window. The carrier also intercepts
the real Dawn `GPUDevice` lifecycle for `bloom-*` textures, parameter buffers,
bind groups, layouts, samplers, and pipelines: stable-frame create/destroy
deltas must be zero, while probe-observed live payload and resize-overlap
peaks are recorded at every intercepted create boundary and frame snapshot.
`residentChildBytes` reports active logical Bloom texture bytes; parameter
buffers, labeled native resources, and in-flight retirement are reported
separately in the performance artifact. `measurement.status` admits timing completeness and resource stability only;
`budget.status` is `not-evaluated` because this carrier declares no elapsed-time
budget or physical-adapter admission. The ten-pass sum is a diagnostic with
repeated interval coverage, never exclusive Bloom cost, frame latency or FPS.
Summing individual pass p95 values is retained only as a non-percentile diagnostic. WebGPU does not expose driver-private
pipeline memory or allocator alignment, so those remain explicitly unavailable.

`scripts/smoke-browser.mjs` runs the same lifecycle on a real Browser WebGPU
canvas, waits for 60 submitted-frame events, captures PNGs, decodes their
pixels, and stores the inspection/readback contract in `evidence/`. It also
checks the enum-on/intensity-zero exact-zero state. Its
surface-reconfigure stage is separate from device-loss recovery. The dev
server uses an ephemeral port and allows the shader-heavy startup up to 120s;
set `FORGEAX_BLOOM_SERVER_START_TIMEOUT_MS` to adjust that bound.
`scripts/smoke-browser-device-loss.mjs` uses the real `Browser.crashGpuProcess`
driver action, waits for `device-lost -> recovering -> alive`, calls the public
`renderer.recover()`, and verifies the ten-pass Bloom graph plus visible PNG
restoration on the replacement device generation. `smoke:all` includes the
receipt-bound performance carrier, so the aggregate gate covers every listed
Bloom evidence class.

## Recovery and evidence

Bloom is authored by `Camera.bloom` and remains inside the Standard post
graph. The disabled value is an exact zero-overhead path: no bloom resources,
passes, uploads, or counters are created. Call `renderer.inspect()` after a
failure, branch on the structured error `code` and typed `detail`, repair the
named owner, and retry the same draw request. The carrier never owns a second
post topology or accesses device handles.

The smoke manifest records current source/build provenance, backend, runner,
frame identity, and the on -> off -> resize -> re-enabled -> surface-reconfigure receipt sequence. Structural
roster evidence and real PNG/readback evidence are distinct; a historical
oracle cannot substitute for either one.
