> [!IMPORTANT]

The package contract is [`packages/rhi-debug/README.md`](../../packages/rhi-debug/README.md).
In an installed game, read `node_modules/@forgeax/engine-rhi-debug/README.md`
or the SDK's `source/engine/packages/rhi-debug/README.md`.

## Diagnose and prove the repair

1. Reproduce the symptom in its actual browser/backend and scene state. Preserve
   the screenshot, errors, and reproduction command; browser-only failures need
   the browser path even when Dawn smokes pass.
2. Capture a bounded failing frame using the host path below. Keep its tape,
   digest, and reproduction inputs unchanged as failure evidence.
3. Derive `FrameModel`, choose the relevant `workIndex`, and inspect pipeline,
   bindings, resource descriptors/data, and supported render-target readback.
   For ray/compute records, use the producer layout with `rhi.inspect`'s `buffer` input or `inspectBufferRecords`; follow the [bounded buffer contract](../../packages/rhi-debug/README.md#structured-compute-and-ray-query-buffers).
   Trace the first incorrect producer or consumer through resource lineage.
   If the expected draw/dispatch is absent, follow extraction, culling, or asset
   readiness upstream; an absent work item is evidence too.
4. Encode the failing path as the smallest useful regression gate and confirm
   it fails, then fix the subsystem identified by those facts. Load material,
   shader, render-pipeline, assets, or RHI skills as the evidence requires. Keep generic
   RHI Debug free of workload-specific lighting, shadow, or post-effect policy;
   repair capture/replay itself only when its contract is the demonstrated fault.
5. Run the regression gate, capture again after the fix, and verify the same
   scene/backend and original visible symptom.
   Keep before/after artifacts explicit; replay evidence supplements the required
   browser, Dawn, and smoke gates for the changed implementation.

If capture, replay, or readback is blocked, preserve the attempted command,
structured failure, and capability result. Follow structured recovery below and
continue with available structural evidence and targeted browser/live checks.
Record what remains unverified; do not replace missing GPU evidence with a
successful mock or hide an Engine gap in game/demo code.

## Game CLI entry

From the game root, discover the installed command contract:

```bash
pnpm exec forgeax help debug rhi --tree --json
pnpm exec forgeax help dev start --json
pnpm exec forgeax dev start --rhi-capture true --json
pnpm exec forgeax debug rhi capture --json
```

If a live owner already exists, stop it before changing its capture options.
Preserve the failing backend and execution tier, reproduce the target state, then
capture. The CLI calls the live host's recorder and persists one `.rhitape`;
retain its returned path and digest. Capture requires a ready recorder-enabled
App; it does not start one automatically. For an embedded host, use the
[CLI live bridge](../forgeax-engine-cli/SKILL.md#rhicapture-single-frame-capture) and persist
`capture.value.bytes` with its digest; a digest-only result cannot be inspected.

Use the returned path and select `summary.works[].workIndex`:

```bash
pnpm exec forgeax debug rhi summary --artifact <path> --json
pnpm exec forgeax debug rhi inspect --artifact <path> --work-index <workIndex> --json
```

Summary, inspection, and the read-only Viewer consume the same `ArtifactRef`;
they do not recapture or infer an input pair. Discover optional inspection fields
through CLI help; precise operation contracts live in
[DevKit](../../packages/devkit/README.md#rhi-debug-operations).

Select `summary.works[].workIndex`; the compact summary omits repeated shader
source. The CLI computes SHA-256 from the file; optional `--digest sha256:...`
checks the expected bytes and rejects a mismatch before replay. Recorder and
CLI share the same `tapeDigest` implementation.

Inspect `summary.unseededResources` (or `FrameModel.unseededResources`) before
trusting pixels. These retained buffers/textures have no captured initial
bytes and replay begins at zero. Confirm the captured frame initializes them
before reading, or recapture the producer. Empty diagnostics do not replace a
live/replay image comparison. `depth32float` seeds include all layers and mips;
other depth/stencil and multisampled contents still require producing work.

For resource release checks, use `FrameModel.resourceLifecycle` and
`resources[].destroyEventIndex`; bootstrap resources have a null creation index.
Locate bound consumers through each work's bindings and attachments. Descriptor
bytes and recorded destruction do not prove driver allocation or retirement timing.

## Mental model

| Concept | Use |
|:--|:--|
| `.rhitape` | One canonical v7 artifact containing the frame events and binary blobs. |
| `EventSemantics` | The method-to-event and handle-lifecycle mapping. |
| `TapeIndex` | Derived event, resource, and work lookup. |
| `FrameModel` | One `works[].workIndex` sequence shared by all inspectors. |
| `ReplaySession` | Fresh backend creation, typed resources, readback, and disposal. |

There is one artifact and one owner per concern. Do not invent a second tape,
selection key, resource registry, or host-side replay model.

## Shortest workflow

1. Attach the recorder to the real RHI backend at the Runtime to App seam.
2. Capture one frame and retain its `{ kind, digest, bytes }` result.
3. Decode the bytes with the strict v7 decoder.
4. Build `FrameModel` and select a `works[].workIndex`.
5. Open a replay session with a factory that creates a fresh backend.
6. Inspect that work item, then dispose the session even on failure.

```ts
const captured = await app.rhiCapture?.captureFrame();
if (!captured?.ok) return captured;
const tape = decodeTape(captured.value.bytes);
if (!tape.ok) return tape;
const model = buildFrameModel(tape.value);
const replay = await openReplay(tape.value, await createFreshBackend(tape.value));
if (!replay.ok) return replay;
try {
  return await replay.value.inspectWork(model.works[0].workIndex, ['pipeline', 'bindings', 'pixels']);
} finally {
  await replay.value.dispose();
}
```

Each `works[].bindings` row carries its static `bufferOffset` and the
`setBindGroup` `dynamicOffset` in effect for that draw (`null` when static). The
effective offset of a buffer binding is `(bufferOffset ?? 0) + (dynamicOffset ?? 0)`;
use it to prove which uniform slot a draw read, such as a per-composition View copy.

Multisampled passes: read the 1x targets named by
`works[i].attachments.colorResolveViewHandleIds` (attachment order, `null` when
single-sample) instead of the 4x color views. Weighted blended OIT shows up as
`fs_oit`/`fs_oit_premultiplied` accumulate works followed by one
`fs_oit_composite` work; `readResourceAtWork` on the accum (rgba16float) and
weight (r16float) ids at the last accumulate work, and on scene color before and
after the composite, separates an accumulation fault from a composite fault.

## Protocol and lifecycle rules

- Accept only `RHITAPE` with `formatVersion: 7`.
- Validate canonical JSON, digest, typed arrays, handles, blobs, cardinality,
  and create/dispose history before replay.
- Reject versions 2 through 6 explicitly.
- Use the same `workIndex` for EventBrowser, PipelineState, TextureViewer,
  ResourceInspector, and DevKit inspect.
- Let `ResourceTable` validate generations and own disposal.
- Use the declared readback format matrix; return structured unsupported or
  failed results instead of guessing a conversion.

## Structured recovery

Expected failures are `Result` values with `RhiDebugError`. Switch on
`error.code` and let TypeScript narrow `error.detail`; do not parse `.hint` or
message text to decide control flow.

| Failure | First action |
|:--|:--|
| `capture-unavailable` | Enable the recorder on the real live host and invoke its `rhiCapture` root; retain startup errors if no frame can run. |
| `capture-snapshot-failed` / `capture-timeout` | Preserve the original cause and `detail.progress`; distinguish queue drain from the named resource readback before choosing a repair owner. |
| `tape-invalid` | Preserve the original bytes and capture again if the source is stale. |
| `tape-version-unsupported` | Use a producer that emits v7; older formats are not compatibility inputs. |
| `replay-capability-mismatch` | Create a fresh backend with the recorded capabilities or record again. |
| `replay-position-invalid` | Select a `workIndex` from the current `FrameModel`. |
| `readback-unsupported` | Keep structural evidence and report the missing backend format capability. |
| `readback-failed` | Preserve the detail stage and dispose the replay session. |

## Viewer evidence

The Viewer is read-only. It loads one `.rhitape`, shows the four linked views
through the shared `workIndex`, and keeps the structural model available when
WebGPU is absent. Pixel inspection is a capability-gated enhancement, not a
reason to replace the tape or create a browser-only model.

For an AI handoff, include the artifact digest, selected `workIndex`, event
anchor, structured error detail when present, backend capability result, and
the exact command or browser path used.

## Platform boundaries

| Platform | Owns |
|:--|:--|
| Browser | DOM file selection, WebGPU backend construction, and raw tape transfer. |
| Node / DevKit | File access, operation discovery, and host-owned fresh backend creation. |
| Dawn | Native backend and pixel evidence. |
| Core package | Protocol, recorder, index, model, replay, and readback contracts. |

The core must not import DOM, Node filesystem APIs, PNG encoders, or Viewer
state. The Vite bridge serves one raw tape in development only.

## Verification

```bash
FORGEAX_SKIP_HARNESS_SYNC=1 pnpm exec tsc -b packages/rhi-debug/tsconfig.json --pretty false
FORGEAX_SKIP_HARNESS_SYNC=1 pnpm --filter @forgeax/engine-rhi-debug exec vitest run --config vitest.config.ts src/__tests__
pnpm test:browser
pnpm test:dawn
```

Use the package and host gates for the changed surface, then preserve the
artifact and its command output as evidence. Do not call an unrun browser or
Dawn gate green.
