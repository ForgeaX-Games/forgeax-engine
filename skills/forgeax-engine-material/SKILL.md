## Contract index

## Lighting asset entry points

Use these entry points:

1. Declare a one-sided rectangular light with `RectAreaLight`; `width` and `height` own its dimensions, and the optional `sourceTexture` (a 2D `TextureAsset` of any size: rgba8/bgra8 sRGB or linear, r8 grayscale, rgba16float/rgba32float clipped to [0, 1] take the CPU projection; KTX2 BC/ETC2/ASTC block formats are resampled from level 0 on the GPU, which needs compute and the device compression feature, otherwise one `feature-not-enabled` error and a white slice) tints diffuse and specular like Unreal's SourceTexture. u follows the light's local +X; an absent handle is uniform emission. Show the same image on an emitter quad yourself; the light does not draw its surface.
2. Declare `iesProfile`, `cookie`, and `rollDeg` on the existing `SpotLight`; `TextureAsset` always owns the cookie.
3. Declare 27 `irradiance` values and `radius` through `LightProbe`; GPU slots, LTC, and the probe registry are not public API.

author -> publish -> admit -> accept -> verify are evidence stages. The IES producer creates cooked `IesProfileAsset` at build time; runtime loads it by GUID. Follow `.code`/`.detail`/`.hint` back to the producer for rebuild; fallback is not verification.

Keep one MaterialAsset subject and one Pack publication. Runtime bool/value
data, composed module slots, and a closed compiler context are inputs; macros,
feature defines, runtime cooking, and app-local fallbacks are not. Trace
`materialContractDigest`, `sourceClosureDigest`, `layoutIdentity`,
`programIdentity`, `cookIdentity`, and `materialPublicationIdentity` from
`current` to `generation`, repair the first producer divergence, cold-cook the
same GUID, and verify receipt, artifact, and provenance.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The visible-object recipe is `MeshFilter` + `MeshRenderer` + `MaterialAsset`. Author one material payload, cook its effective contract, load it by GUID, and allocate the World handle. The recovery route is structured error inspection. Do not create an app-local shader artifact or bypass an engine resource defect in a demo.

## Color-lighting parity handoff

For a direct-light material issue, use the [color-lighting parity entry](../../apps/parity/color-lighting/README.md), then follow its [status recovery map](../../apps/parity/color-lighting/status-index.md). The `SceneCase` and `CaseReport` schemas are the report contract; repair the named material or producer owner and rerun the same case. Do not turn a missing producer capture into a material pass.

## Direct-light parity entry

When a visible material is used by a direct-light parity case, start with the
revision-pinned
[`three-r184-finite-range-authority.json`](../../apps/parity/color-lighting/cases/direct-light/calibration/three-r184-finite-range-authority.json)
and its executable authority test. The entry is `ready` only with a matching
Three revision/source hash, fixed config, and complete expected samples;
missing fields mean `blocked` and require evidence recovery.

The shared light vocabulary is:

| Field | Public meaning |
|:--|:--|
| `DirectionalLight.intensity` | Lux in a one-world-unit-per-meter scene |
| `PointLight.intensity` | Candela with positive meter range or no cutoff |
| `SpotLight.intensity` | Candela with meter range and KHR cone mapping |
| `color` | Linear RGB, without a global compensation factor |
| `cosInner` / `cosOuter` | Snapshot fields derived from imported cone radians |
| `direction` | Extract-normalized world direction consumed by both pipelines |

The runtime range factor is the Three r184 squared window
`clamp(1 - (d / c)^4, 0, 1)^2`; KHR's unsquared curve remains an import/reference
falsification and must not be used as the Forge runtime curve. Exposure belongs
to the camera tone/output stage after lighting, so material authoring and light
intensity do not receive an exposure multiplier.

For diagnosis, run the authority and light-snapshot tests, inspect the
normalized snapshot and its buffer projection, then compare independent
browser WebGPU and Dawn captures. Preserve the case `provenance`, named
`captures`, raw hash, analytic/ROI metrics, and `CaseReport.verdict`. Do not
replace a missing engine path with a custom mesh, fallback shader, or app-local
light profile.

## Transmission/refraction

Use the existing `Materials.standard` entry with transmission, IOR, thickness, attenuation, and named
texture values. Smooth/rough refraction, edge fallback, and transparent ordering are renderer-owned;
inspect `renderer.inspect().transmission` for detached capability/resource/lifecycle facts. GLTF
transmission is producer-owned and must be repaired through source -> Pack -> GUID load, including the
structured BLEND rejection path.

On a 16-sampled-texture device, transmission shares the `metallicTexture` / `roughnessTexture` /
`alphaTexture` slots. Authoring one of those split maps on a transmissive material there drops
refraction and reports `MaterialSampledTextureBudgetExceededError` (`detail.conflicts` names the
maps); remove them or target a 21-texture device. Check before rendering with
`materialSampledTextureBudget(world, assets, handle)` or the `material.preview` result's
`sampledTextureBudget`. Contract: `packages/render/README.md` §Standard sampled-texture budget.

## Diffuse transmission (foliage, paper, thin cloth)

Back-lit thin surfaces use `diffuseTransmission` (0..1) and `diffuseTransmissionColor`, with optional
`diffuseTransmissionTexture` (alpha, linear) and `diffuseTransmissionColorTexture` (RGB, sRGB), the
`KHR_materials_diffuse_transmission` model. It is opaque light passing through, not refraction: no
`transmission`, no depth-write change, no backdrop copy.

The factor is a split, not an extra term: reflected `(1 - factor) · baseColor`, transmitted
`factor · tint`, so a white leaf in a white sky stays at 1 on both sides. `factor = 1` is a lossless
frosted diffuser, never glass; use `transmission` for see-through. Leaves sit near 0.3-0.6. Unreal
two-sided foliage adds `SubsurfaceColor` on top of full diffuse (about 2x in a white furnace); convert
with `S = max(1, |Base| + |Sub|)`, `factor = |Sub| / (|Base| + |Sub|)`,
`baseColor = Base / (S · (1 - factor))`, `tint = Sub / (S · factor)` (`|c|` = largest channel), which
matches Unreal's path-traced balance, and do not port its GGX back-scatter peak (render README
§Factor semantics).

1. Author values with `Materials.standard({ diffuseTransmission, diffuseTransmissionColor, ... })` and
   `renderState.cullMode: 'none'` so the back face rasterizes.
2. Bind it to a cooked Standard alias root: module id containing `::standard-`, the five canonical
   user-region textures, and the diffuse-transmission parameter names. The built-in
   `forgeax::default-standard-pbr` root is layer-free, so values alone stay inert.
3. The layer is Forward-only; do not expect it in a Deferred GBuffer. Authored alias roots currently
   draw on the per-entity CPU lane and compile out clustered and rect-area lights (render README
   §Diffuse transmission); budget dense foliage accordingly.
4. Verify with the back-lit falsifier pattern in `apps/hello/foliage-transmission` (opaque control
   stays dark, factor 0 must fail), its white furnace (factors 0, 0.5, 1 match the opaque white
   control; `FALSIFY=additive` must fail), and its RHI Debug browser smoke, which checks the bound pipeline's
   module and 68/69 bindings.

A glTF source carrying the extension imports through the same fields; out-of-range values fail as
`gltf-material-physical-invalid`.

## Projection and non-PBR materials

| Need | Entry |
|:--|:--|
| Texture without usable UVs (rocks, terrain, kitbash) | `Materials.standard({ ..., triplanar: { space: 'world' \| 'object', scale, sharpness } })` |
| Baked object-space normal map | `Materials.standard({ normalTexture, normalMapSpace: 'object' })` |
| Diffuse only, no highlight | `Materials.lambert({ baseColor, ... })` |
| Lit look without lights (sculpt, preview) | `Materials.matcap({ texture, sampler })` |
| Debug the shading normal | `Materials.normal()` |

`space: 'object'` keeps the texture on a moving mesh; `'world'` keeps it in the
world. Triplanar refuses alpha masking and the slots it cannot project, and
object-space normals refuse `bumpTexture`, with `material-authoring-contract-invalid`
(`detail.parameter` names the option). Neither reaches the ray reference
(`ray-material-unsupported`). Matcap and Normal are unlit: no lights, no
shadow receipt. Evidence and falsifiers live in `apps/hello/material-projection`
(render README §Projection and the non-PBR material family).

## Order-independent transparency

Transparent draws composite in back-to-front sorted order by default. For
interpenetrating or cyclic transparent layers, set the view's
`Camera.transparency` to `TRANSPARENCY_WEIGHTED_BLENDED`. Do not reorder
entities or split meshes in the app. There is no per-material opt-in.

A draw accumulates only when all of these hold:
- its blend is straight over (`src-alpha / one-minus-src-alpha`) or
  premultiplied over (`one / one-minus-src-alpha`);
- depth writes are off;
- it is an unskinned built-in Standard or Unlit `fs_main` draw without `outputs`.

Every other transparent draw stays in the sorted pass after the composite.
Read `renderer.inspect().transparency.ineligible` for its reason:
`blend-not-eligible`, `depth-write-enabled` or `program-without-oit-output`.
Repair the material's render state, or accept sorted, rather than parsing
messages.

The result has exact coverage and a depth-weighted average color. It is not
the exact over-operator for overlapping layers. See the
[OIT section](../../packages/render/README.md#order-independent-transparency).

## Mental model

The recovery route is structured error inspection followed by source or cook
repair; it never adds a parallel material surface.

`MaterialAsset` owns `passes`, `parameters`, `values`, and optional `parent`.
The root owns the effective contract. A child inherits the root and supplies
only its changed values. A texture value is structured:

```ts
{
  texture: textureGuid,
  sampler: samplerGuid,
  coordinates: {
    set: 1,
    transform: { offset: [0.1, 0.2], scale: [2, 2], rotation: 0.25 },
  },
}
```

The coordinate set and transform remain attached to the named texture slot.
The glTF bridge, pack cook, runtime extract, and built-in PBR shader consume
that same data.

For a render target or reflection probe, the material consumes the public
`RenderTargetTextureSource` projection produced by the Renderer. The source is
bound to the named texture slot with its exact dimension and mip view; it is not
an asset handle or an app-local texture registry. A `3d` or `2d-array` target
binds to a `texture_3d` or `texture_2d_array` param (source `dimension: '3d'` /
`'2d-array'`); a material sampling a target is excluded from that target's own
capture. Probe sampling uses the
renderer-owned selected probe, roughness mip, local box projection, and
Skylight irradiance fallback. Read pixels only after the matching
`FrameReceipt.completed` promise resolves.

A caller `GPUTexture` or a video uses `renderer.importTexture({ kind:
'gpu-texture' | 'video', ... })`; bind `handle.source` through
`world.allocSharedRef('ExternalTextureSource', ...)` into any texture slot
(ordinary slots copy video frames). For zero-copy video, the root declares a
`texture_external` parameter and the entity uses a child material
`{ kind: 'material', parent: rootGuid, values: { slot: source } }`; spreading the
loaded root payload into a new object loses its cooked projection. Branch on
`external-texture-invalid` / `external-texture-state-invalid` `detail.reason`
(`packages/render/README.md` §External textures).

Standard PBR always applies geometric specular anti-aliasing: roughness widens
by the screen-space normal spread in Forward, Deferred, IBL, and clearcoat.
Do not raise authored roughness or add a custom shader to hide sparkling
highlights on curved low-roughness surfaces. The contract lives in
`packages/shader/README.md` under Standard lit shader contract.

Specular IBL also compensates multiple scattering, so rough metal keeps its
energy: in a uniform environment a white metal matches the sky at every
roughness. Do not brighten rough metals with a higher `baseColor`, `intensity`,
or an emissive term to offset split-sum darkening; that loss no longer exists.

## Author, cook, load

```ts
const material: MaterialAsset = {
  kind: 'material',
  parent: parentGuid,
  values: { baseColor: [0.2, 0.55, 0.95, 1] },
};

assets.configurePackIndex('/pack-index.json');
const loaded = await assets.loadByGuid<MaterialAsset>(materialGuid);
if (!loaded.ok) {
  report(loaded.error.code, loaded.error.detail, loaded.error.hint);
  return;
}
const handle = world.allocSharedRef('MaterialAsset', loaded.value);
```

For a custom module, put `passes[].program.module` in the root contract. The
shader build publishes the module; the material cook publishes the record and
artifact. The application only performs the catalog load and readiness check.

## Points and Lines route

For first-class point or line authoring, route the request through the existing
asset and material owners:

1. Confirm the `MeshAsset` has `point-list` or paired `line-list` topology.
2. Admit exactly one `Points` or `Lines` component with finite positive
   `sizePx` or `width`. `Lines.widthUnits` selects `pixels` (default) or
   `world`; `Lines.cap` selects `butt` (default) or `round` ends and joins.
3. Select `Materials.unlit`; do not author a replacement shader or mesh.
4. Let Standard extract, prepare, and record the retained expansion.
5. Use `renderer.inspect` and the RHI debug capture when source, derived,
   binding, or draw evidence is needed.

Admission is atomic. Unsupported topology, invalid style, lane conflicts, or a
missing unlit forward material return a structured refusal. Read `.code`,
`.expected`, `.hint`, and narrowed `.detail`; never infer support from a
message or silently substitute a generic mesh draw.

The direct WebGPU probe is runtime evidence. Clustered unlit, WebGL2 capability
restrictions, and RhiNull structural-only records are separate evidence rows;
RhiNull does not prove pixels or hardware timing. Recovery is inspect, repair
the named source or producer, rebuild or cold-cook, then retry the same
retained/prepared renderer owner. There is no new CLI, RPC, registry, cache, or
recovery ledger for this route.

## Built-in PBR slots

Built-in PBR names its coordinate records by texture slot: base color,
metallic roughness, normal, specular tint, emissive, and occlusion. Each record
contains offset, scale, rotation, coordinate set, and physical extent data.
The vertex input selects the requested coordinate set and clamps only when the
primitive has fewer sets than the material requires.

## Recovery checklist

| Symptom | Inspect | Recovery |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Black standard material | `DirectionalLight`, effective pass, render error | Add the required light or repair the pass, then draw again |
| `material-parent-not-found` | `detail.missingParent`, `detail.chain` | Fix the GUID and re-cook the child |
| `material-circular-inheritance` | `detail.chain` | Remove the repeated parent and re-cook |
| `material-value-unknown` | `detail.parameter` | Declare the parameter in the root contract or remove the value |
| `material-value-type-mismatch` | `detail.expectedType`, `detail.actualType` | Change the value and re-cook |
| `material-specialization-not-cooked` | requested material and selection | Run the cook path and publish the record and artifact |
| `material-specialization-stale-generation` | `detail.dependencies` | Re-cook after dependent sources settle |
| `gltf-material-uv-set-missing` | slot and available sets | Add the source UV set and re-import |

Read `.code`, `.expected`, `.hint`, and the narrowed `.detail`; this is the
recovery route, and it never parses a diagnostic message or silently replaces
an engine resource.

## Routing

- Material shape and error union: [`packages/types/README.md`](../../packages/types/README.md)
- Pack/cook record: [`packages/pack/README.md`](../../packages/pack/README.md)
- Shader module and reflection: [`packages/shader/README.md`](../../packages/shader/README.md)
- Runtime catalog: [`packages/assets-runtime/README.md`](../../packages/assets-runtime/README.md)
- Migration: [`docs/material-asset-migration.md`](https://github.com/ForgeaX-Games/forgeax-engine-harness/blob/main/docs/material-asset-migration.md)

## Visibility is a render boundary, not a material field

Quick start: author `Visibility` through ECS, inspect its effective state from
the render package, and leave `MaterialAsset` unchanged:

```ts
import { Visibility, VisibilityStateValue, resolveVisibility } from '@forgeax/engine-scene';

world.spawn({ component: Visibility, data: { state: VisibilityStateValue.hidden } }).unwrap();
const snapshot = resolveVisibility(world);
```

| Question | Authority | Recovery |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Why is an entity hidden? | `Visibility` intent plus `resolveVisibility` | Inspect `source` and hierarchy diagnostics |
| Why did a material fail? | Material/shader structured errors | Repair the cooked contract and retry |
| Why is the count unexpected? | `renderer.inspect().visibilityStats` | Inspect the renderer candidate path |

Do not replace a missing material, mesh, camera, or visibility path with a
demo-side stand-in. Visibility does not own camera, picking, lifecycle, assets,
or VFX shadow behavior. Those are out of scope for this material skill.
## Custom multiple outputs

`passes[].outputs` declares ordered named color outputs with format, optional
blend and writeMask. WGSL `@location(n)` selects index n. Cook validates the
selected fragment interface; load through the ordinary GUID route. Bind matching
RenderGraph targets through [public MRT](../../packages/render/README.md#public-material-mrt),
then inspect all attachments through RHI Debug rather than accepting color alone.

## Color writes and coplanar overlays

Use `renderState.colorWriteMask` (RGBA bits 1/2/4/8, default 15) for per-channel
writes. Mask 0 with depth writes enabled makes an invisible occluder; place it
before affected opaque geometry with the existing queue. Use `depthBias` (signed
32-bit constant units), `depthBiasSlopeScale`, and optional `depthBiasClamp` for
polygon offset. Zero defaults need no enable flag. Negative bias pulls forward
under conventional less-depth; an overlay usually disables depth writes.
With multiple outputs, this mask intersects each output's `writeMask`.

Generated shadow passes retain polygon offset and culling but own depth writes;
color suppression does not disable shadows. Derived temporal attachments write
all scene-data channels. See the [pass table and RHI Debug regression commands](../../packages/render/README.md#material-color-writes-and-polygon-depth-offset)
before interpreting masks on deferred/MRT attachments. Inspect both pipeline
state and live/fresh-replay pixels, including the zero-bias and write-off controls.
