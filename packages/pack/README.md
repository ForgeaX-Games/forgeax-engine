## MaterialAsset 唯一成功路径

Pack 承载 `paramSchema -> derive -> compile/reflect -> cook/load -> extract/record`
中的 cook/load 边界：producer 先发布含 `coordinateSet`、transform、
`physicalUvScale`、artifact 与 `layoutIdentity` 的 receipt，再由 catalog 按 GUID
提供给 runtime。identity 或 receipt 过期时 inspect producer evidence，修复后
recook 并重新验证，不手改 cooked payload。

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Pack 是发布与证据边界，不是第二份 schema；恢复动作依赖结构化状态与 receipt，
> 并沿 producer owner 回到源输入。

## Authoring and recovery index

## ScriptablePack 与 Pack authoring

A `terrain` ScriptablePack output supplies a validated `TerrainSource`. The terrain producer derives subsection meshes, height/control mips and Standard material arrays as one GUID-linked closure; the existing Pack cook, Catalog and runtime loader own publication. See [the terrain contract](../terrain/README.md) for bounds and layer semantics.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 这里有两个一等 source 实体，且必须保持可见区别：`ScriptablePack` 是可执行的
> `*.pack.ts` TypeScript source；`Pack` 是可编辑、可持久化的 `*.pack.json` JSON
> source。参数化只是 ScriptablePack/Pack instance 的可选能力，不是第三种实体。
> 构建后的 Pack v2 是 transport 产物；runtime 只按 GUID 加载产物。

The current authoring contract keeps one Pack identity and derives every output
identity from the author-owned pair `(packageId, sourceKey)`:

```ts
import { AssetGuid, definePack, definePackageId } from '@forgeax/engine/pack/source';
import { ok } from '@forgeax/engine/types';

const packageId = definePackageId('01900000-0000-7000-8000-000000000001');

export default definePack({
  schemaVersion: '2.0.0',
  packageId,
  build: ({ packageId: subjectId }) =>
    ok({
      'mesh/main': { kind: 'mesh', materialSlots: [] },
      'scene/hero': {
        kind: 'scene',
        entities: { body: { components: {} } },
      },
      'scene/main': {
        kind: 'scene',
        entities: {
          root: { components: {} },
          hero: {
            components: {},
            instance: {
              source: AssetGuid.format(AssetGuid.derive(subjectId, 'scene/hero')),
              overrides: [{ target: ['body'], components: {} }],
            },
          },
        },
      },
    }),
});
```

`definePack` omits `parameters` for the default zero-parameter path; its build
context then has `packageId` and `readByGuid()` only. A non-empty `parameters`
array opts into typed `values`, defaults, numeric bounds, enum choices, vectors,
colors, and asset-GUID kind constraints. The build return object is the whole
current output topology: there is no output manifest, `output.add()`,
`externalAssets`, or per-output GUID field.

`Pack` authoring (`*.pack.json`) uses schema `3.0.0`. A direct document stores
`assets[sourceKey]`; an instance stores only its own `packageId`, `parent`, and
sparse `values`. These branches are mutually exclusive. Every instance has an
independent package identity, while the parent chain is resolved through the
current Source Index. The authoring form is lowered to the ordinary Pack v2
transport before runtime; player code still calls `loadByGuid()` and never
executes TypeScript or understands parameters.

`@forgeax/engine-pack/build` exposes the filesystem gateway
`createFileSystemPackAuthoringGateway()`. Its read operations are
`asset.list`, `asset.inspect`, `asset.resolve`, and `asset.verify`; mutations
are `asset-source.create`, `asset-source.clone`,
`asset-source.create-instance`, `asset-source.apply-values`,
`asset-source.rebuild`, and `asset-source.cold-cook`. Every operation carries a
caller-minted `requestId`; source mutations are confined to the game root,
atomic, and CAS-protected by `expectedRevision`.

| `asset.inspect` subject | Authored result |
|:--|:--|
| Pack source path | Source revision and output identities; no output payloads |
| Pack source path with `sourceKey` | The selected direct Pack output's `payload`, GUID and source revision |
| Pack instance path with `sourceKey` | The derived output GUID and inherited `effectiveValues` |

Consumers comparing a selected output with a live Catalog row must require the
returned GUID to match. A ScriptablePack source inspection does not execute
`build` to synthesize an authored payload.

`AssetGuid.derive(packageId, sourceKey)` is the browser-safe UUIDv5 projection.
`PackageId` and `AssetGuid` are distinct brands, and a derived identity alone
reports only `identity`; `present` and `ready` require current materialization
and validated Pack/artifact evidence respectively.

## 灯光 Pack/Catalog 入口

三条最短入口：

1. scene Pack 只保存 `RectAreaLight`、`SpotLight`、`LightProbe` 的 authored 字段，并把 `iesProfile`/`cookie` 写入 `refs`。
2. `IesProfileAsset` 由 `iesImporter` 在 build-time 生成 fixed cooked payload；`SpotLight.cookie` 仍是普通 `TextureAsset`。
3. runtime 按 GUID 读取 Catalog/Pack 记录；`current`、`accepted`、`lastKnownGood`、`verified` 分层检查，缺失时回到 producer 重建。

Pack 是 published 边界，不是 author authority、runtime registry 或 GPU owner。源文件与 Meta 保留 authored identity，DDC/Catalog 是可丢弃或可重建的 projection；`sourceKey` 只表达 producer 语义，不是 URL 替身。

## Material contract index

Pack is the single material-cook and publication boundary. It publishes one
GUID-addressed receipt and artifact for the resolved contract; it does not
redefine `paramSchema` or mint runtime feature macros. Keep
`materialContractDigest`, `sourceClosureDigest`, `layoutIdentity`,
`programIdentity`, `cookIdentity`, and `materialPublicationIdentity` together
as layered identity. Inspect `current` versus `generation`, repair the owning
producer at the first divergence, cold-cook the same GUID, and verify receipt,
artifact, and provenance.

A raster ABI without `sceneIndexEntry` publishes a direct selection only. When
that entry exists, the validator requires both direct and scene-index selections
for the same pass/context/color inputs. A scene address without its matching ABI
entry is invalid; direct-only publications do not fabricate a paired program.

`MaterialCookRasterContext.visibleSurface` is an optional `true` capability
axis, orthogonal to `pipeline: forward | deferred`. Absence is the only off
representation. `materialProgramContextForPass` preserves it for color entries
and strips it for shadow/depth entries; the cooker and runtime share that
projection. It selects an additional output ABI from the same authored Surface,
not a second material definition.

`MaterialCookRasterContext.geometry` distinguishes `sprite-instances` from
ordinary `mesh`/`sprite` layouts. This is a derived program selection within
the same material GUID; it does not add a second authoring asset.

`MaterialCookProgramContext` is the closed union of raster and Surface-derivative
contexts. Derivatives use `pipeline: ray`, `profile: forgeax-material-ray-v1` and
mesh/storage inputs: `pass: ray-hit` selects `cs_surface`, while `pass: card-capture`
selects `vs_card` with the fixed `fs_card` fragment entry. Both select an existing
authored pass without a raster address pair or submission ABI. Card cooking
validates its four `rgba16float` outputs. The executable validator and JSON schema
admit both contexts; `raster-probe` remains a build-time diagnostic. The complete
program-set digest covers both derivatives and raster programs. Neither derivative
satisfies the requirement to publish the authored raster pass.

## Mesh binary boundary

Mesh artifacts use one canonical `geometry` projection and one strict wire
contract. The pack package owns the header facts and digest implementation in
[`src/mesh-bin-contract.ts`](src/mesh-bin-contract.ts); consumers must not
recreate that table.

| Fact | Owner | Recovery |
|:--|:--|:--|
| projection mask, schema version, stride, digest | `@forgeax/engine-geometry` + pack contract | Re-cook from source and Meta |
| vertex/index cardinality and payload bounds | build-time import producer | Repair source payload, then cold-cook |
| malformed or legacy mesh binary | strict runtime loader | Keep LKG; publish only a fully validated replacement |

> [!WARNING]
> Producers emit v5; readers accept published v4 and v5. v2/v3 remain
> closed load errors. Runtime never re-cooks an artifact.

## ScriptablePack in 30 seconds

The public happy path is: declare one stable `packageId` and return a complete
`sourceKey -> Asset` topology from `definePack`, run the Vite Pack producer,
publish Pack v2 plus the Catalog, then call `AssetRegistry.loadByGuid(guid)`.
The durable consumer matrix is the exported
`SCRIPTABLE_PACK_ASSET_KINDS` list: mesh, material, scene, texture, equirect,
sampler, font, render-pipeline, tileset, video, skeleton, skin,
animation-clip, animation-graph, audio, particle-effect, and ies-profile.

Every successful row keeps its `sourceKey` identity, dependency `refs`, and
producer-owned `artifacts`. Audio keeps `mediaType` and bytes; particle effects
keep `programFingerprint` and the cooked program. Animation and tile consumers
turn a loaded payload into a World-owned shared reference at their own boundary.

For failure, switch on `code`, inspect `expected`, `hint`, and narrowed `detail`:
repair the definition or producer, rebuild/cold-cook, refresh the Catalog LKG,
or attach the missing Host capability. A missing audio/video/VFX capability is
an install/play/execute error, not a durable-load error. The machine contract
lives in [`pack.schema.json`](schema/pack.schema.json) and
[`meta.schema.json`](schema/meta.schema.json); this section is guidance, not a
second manifest.

The machine contract is [`schemas/asset-authority.schema.json`](../../schemas/asset-authority.schema.json). The audit gate is [`check-asset-authority-audit.mjs`](../../scripts/forgeax/check-asset-authority-audit.mjs); it reports subject, execution, author authority, runtime source, lifecycle, owner, producer, and sourceKey evidence for every named category.

The staged route is explicit: `author-validation` -> `external-declaration` ->
`import` -> `native-cook` -> `ddc-validation` -> `runtime-parse` ->
`editor-capability`. Each stage keeps its own evidence; a cache hit does not
replace author authority, and an Editor capability does not become a runtime
source.

| Need | Entry | Safe action |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Inspect one asset | `forgeax asset inspect --subject <guid> --root <project> --json` | Read structured evidence and diagnostics |
| Verify a result | `forgeax asset verify --root <project> --json` | Repair the producer or package, then retry |
| Rebuild a cooked result | Pack/import runner and the declared producer | Cold cook after discarding invalid DDC |
| Preview old output | Catalog evidence with explicit last-known-good state | Preview only; never publish it as current |

Pack or external source plus Meta owns author facts. DDC and Catalog are derived projections; they are not author databases or write authorities.

## Engine builtin mesh descriptors

The Engine-owned primitive mesh identities are published from one UUIDv5 table
(`@forgeax/engine-pack/builtin`). A standalone DevKit build materializes only
the missing rows as an ordinary Pack v2 tuple; Geometry then derives the mesh
payload from the `procedural-*` token at load time.

| Descriptor | GUID source | Geometry token |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Cube | `HANDLE_CUBE` | `procedural-cube` |
| Triangle | `HANDLE_TRIANGLE` | `procedural-triangle` |
| Quad | `HANDLE_QUAD` | `procedural-quad` |
| Sphere | `HANDLE_SPHERE` | `procedural-sphere` |
| Nine-slice quad | `HANDLE_NINESLICE_QUAD` | `procedural-nine-slice-quad` |
| Cylinder | `HANDLE_CYLINDER` | `procedural-cylinder` |

This keeps the runtime registry generic while ensuring a packaged game can
resolve legacy scene references without a second process-static asset owner.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The pack contract has one material authoring shape: a `MaterialAsset` payload. The cook stage resolves inheritance, values, texture coordinates, module references, artifact bytes, and a receipt into one record. Runtime consumers use the GUID and catalog locator; they do not author a second shader resource.

## MaterialAsset cook contract

Put the material payload in the package `assets[]` row and keep its `refs[]` graph complete. The `passes`, `values`, `parent`, and texture `coordinates` remain one authored route. A valid cooked material record contains `resolved`, `refs`, `artifact`, and `receipt`. If any part is absent, recover by fixing the producer payload or re-running the cook; this is the recovery route. Then repeat `lookup/verify --guid --project --catalog --json`.

当 `parameters` 将字段声明为 `texture` 时，`values` 可保留纹理 GUID 字符串简写；省略
`parameters` 的默认材质也只对 `MATERIAL_TEXTURE_SLOTS` 中的纹理槽启用该简写。只有
sampler、强度或非默认坐标等附加元数据才使用结构化纹理对象。坐标字段的省略由运行时
统一解析为 identity，但 cook/load 不得把 identity 坐标自动展开并写回创作 payload。

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The producer publishes facts; the consumer does not guess. `packageId`,
> `provenance`, `revision`, `sourceKey`, relations, and diagnostics survive
> package moves and DDC relocation. Paths and array positions are locators,
> not identities.

Disk schema, GUID tools (`AssetGuid` brand + UUIDv7/v5), mesh-binary wire facts, and scanner fail-fast chain (13-member `PackErrorCode`) for the ForgeaX asset package system. The unified `asset list`, `asset inspect`, and `asset verify` commands call this owner in filesystem mode; they are offline and require no WS connection.

> Package name vs directory: this package is published as `@forgeax/engine-pack` but lives at `packages/pack` on disk. The `@forgeax/engine-` prefix is the IDE-autocomplete entrypoint AI users discover the package family by; the directory drops the prefix to keep tree depth flat (mirrors the `packages/runtime` / `@forgeax/engine-runtime` pair). All other packages in the engine family follow the same convention.

## AssetEvidence: the offline proof chain

Pack owns the offline half of the GUID evidence chain: `source inventory -> catalog packageUrl/cookReceiptUrl -> producer CookReceipt -> Pack v2 package and artifact verification -> AssetEvidence`.

The catalog is a locator, not proof. `lookup/verify --guid --project --catalog --json` joins the source meta or authored pack, the catalog row, the receipt, and the package descriptors. Both commands emit one JSON record on stdout or one structured `{code, expected, hint, detail}` record on stderr; there is no runtime or WebSocket dependency.

## VFX Program v3 in Pack v2

VFX source v3 is cooked in one atomic producer step and stored in the ordinary
Pack v2 envelope. The executable contract is
`scripts/asset-cook-contract.mjs`; a package-local scripts path is not valid.
The cook publishes the Pack payload and
`particle-effect/program.json` with the same source fingerprint. Runtime loads
the GUID-indexed artifact and never compiles author WGSL.

When adding a Batch B renderer, update the source declaration, explicit material
or mesh refs, native-cook catalog, and receipt together. Re-run `lookup` and
`verify`; stale output is repaired by the owning importer or native cooker, not
by a demo-side mesh substitute.

`notCooked` means a source declaration has no successful receipt. `ready/current` means the receipt fingerprint matches the source; `ready/stale` means it does not. `unknown` is reserved for missing evidence. Artifact and package status remain `notChecked`, `passed`, or `failed`; a historical receipt never upgrades an unchecked package.

Build-time importers write source meta and producer receipts; the Vite plugin publishes the locator. Runtime packages consume the resulting Pack v2 bytes and must not import this Node-only evidence adapter. See [`packages/types/src/asset-evidence.ts`](../types/src/asset-evidence.ts) for the exact schema and closed errors.

Browser runtime code uses the focused Pack subpaths instead of the Node-oriented
root barrel. The root entry remains the build-time scanner/evidence surface.

| Runtime need | Browser-safe entry |
|:--|:--|
| Pack v2 validation and parsing | `@forgeax/engine-pack/runtime` |
| Artifact locator validation | `@forgeax/engine-pack/artifact-path` |
| Cooked material records | `@forgeax/engine-pack/material-cook` |
| Mesh wire facts | `@forgeax/engine-pack/mesh-bin-contract` |

## Quick start

### ScriptablePack source (`*.pack.ts`)

Use `@forgeax/engine-pack/source` when one trusted TypeScript source declares
and builds a multi-asset package. The definition owns one stable `packageId`;
each build returns ordinary typed Assets keyed by author-owned `sourceKey`.
The Pack boundary derives every output GUID as
`AssetGuid.derive(packageId, sourceKey)`, so the source does not contain a
per-output GUID table, `externalAssets`, or an output writer.

```ts
import { AssetGuid, definePackageId, definePack } from '@forgeax/engine/pack/source';
import { ok } from '@forgeax/engine/types';

const packageId = definePackageId('01900000-0000-7000-8000-000000000001');

export default definePack({
  schemaVersion: '2.0.0',
  packageId,
  build: ({ packageId: subjectId }) =>
    ok({
      'mesh/main': { kind: 'mesh', payload: {}, refs: [] },
      'scene/main': {
        kind: 'scene',
        payload: { mesh: AssetGuid.derive(subjectId, 'mesh/main') },
        refs: [],
      },
    }),
});
```

Omitting `parameters` selects the zero-parameter path; a non-empty
`parameters` array adds typed `values`, defaults, ranges, enum choices,
vectors, colors, and asset-GUID constraints. The isolated Pack worker passes
only serializable authoring data to the build and never exposes filesystem or
runtime state.

Custom build-only content uses `PackCookSource` in the same output map:

```ts
{ 'volume/main': { kind: 'game-volume', execution: 'cooked', source: { size: values.size } } }
```

Register the matching `NativeCooker` in the build host. The host supplies the
derived GUID, source key/path and source data; the cooker returns matching-kind
metadata, references and artifact bytes. Missing cookers, rewritten GUIDs and
invalid products fail before publication. Custom sources can coexist with
ordinary Assets and inherit normal Pack parameters and instance identities.
They cannot override the closed ordinary Asset kinds. Authoring `readByGuid`
can explicitly request a `PackCookSource` from the current build generation;
that is source data, not a decoded runtime asset. Runtime custom kinds still
need their normal Registry loader/decoder. No cooker enters the player.

`forgeax asset inspect --subject <source.pack.ts> --root <project> --json` executes module initialization, validates the default export, and projects canonical Meta without calling `build`. `@forgeax/engine-pack/source-node` accepts a host executor with `load` and optional `dispose`; `timeoutMs` bounds module initialization and `buildTimeoutMs` bounds one `build(context)` call. A build timeout returns one structured `pack-source-load-failed` Result with `detail.phase: 'build'`, the configured `timeoutMs`, and deterministic cleanup of the isolated worker and compile root.

The default worker executes the complete relative TypeScript module closure on the supported Node floor, including Node 22 hosts that do not load `.ts` files directly. It transpiles that closure into a disposable ESM directory, resolves bare imports through the source project's nearest `node_modules`, and removes the directory when the worker is disposed. Bulk producers can use the internal `createScriptablePackModuleExecutorPool()` with two recyclable workers; a pooled lease is released after metadata projection or one build.

Path-only scans and explicit `metadataOnly` inventories read at most four ScriptablePack modules concurrently, each in its own isolated worker. They settle all started reads before reporting failure and publish declarations in source order. Inventories retaining build closures and scans using a caller-owned executor remain serial; metadata parallelism never shares or recycles those live leases.

| Standalone project stage | Worker ownership |
|:--|:--|
| Inventory | Metadata workers release before the inventory returns |
| Plugin bootstrap | One recyclable execution lease, acquired when each source or instance builds |
| Formal production | One recyclable execution lease per worklist attempt; the pool closes on success or failure |

`createLazyScriptablePackDefinition()` reloads from the inventory's captured
`ScriptablePackSourceSnapshot`, preserving its module bytes, parameters and source
evidence without keeping an idle worker per declaration. It retains the default
module/build deadlines, package identity fence and reader context. Later author
edits do not replace the captured body; existing publication source fences still
own whether the candidate can publish. The lazy path adds no per-build disk
verification. A direct producer lacking the inventory snapshot captures and
compares its source closure before executing, so a new body cannot use old evidence.
Caller-supplied metadata inventories must carry their captured snapshot;
legacy inventories without a snapshot continue to consume their retained definitions.

`inventoryScriptablePackSource(path, initialSourceText?, resolveImport?)` inventories
bytes without evaluation. Its default resolver follows these authoring rules;
runtime delivery may inject its bundler resolver for each literal dependency,
so published JavaScript keeps its actual file and package resolution semantics.

`createScriptablePackSourceSnapshot()` shares file bytes, content digests and
resolution observations within one build. Pass it through scanner/loader
`sourceSnapshot` options or the inventory helper's fourth argument. Captured
relative modules execute from those bytes in the standard Worker; bare packages
remain the host's pinned dependency context. `verify()` rereads contents and
resolution probes, including newly preferred candidates and symlink changes.
The build owner must verify again immediately before publication and discard a
stale candidate. A fresh build creates a fresh snapshot; only content-keyed
syntax parsing survives across generations. No caller maintains an invalidation list.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Source authoring is an explicit Node contract. Every gateway call carries a
> caller-minted `requestId`; mutations may carry `expectedRevision` for
> SHA-256 CAS. The filesystem port confines paths to one game root and only

> edits fail closed with stable `pack-source-*` errors.

`PACK_AUTHORING_OPERATION_DESCRIPTORS` is the producer-owned structured capability manifest for tools. The existing `asset.preflight` operation returns the current revision, canonical Meta, incoming references, and shape-derived mutation capabilities before any write.

```typescript
import { AssetGuid } from "@forgeax/engine/pack/guid";
import { scan, scanInventory } from "@forgeax/engine/pack/scanner";

// Runtime: resolve a known GUID at build time
const result = AssetGuid.parse("cbe42beb-8975-5096-b3a1-3dda4cb4c077");
if (!result.ok) throw result.error; // PackError with .code 'pack-guid-malformed'
const guid = result.value;

// Build / CI: validate an asset directory
const scanResult = await scan(["apps/hello/cube/assets"]);
if (!scanResult.ok) throw scanResult.error; // PackError with .code/.hint/.detail
console.log(scanResult.value); // PackEntry[]

// Build hosts can retain one validated inventory and project paths from it.
const inventory = await scanInventory(["apps/hello/cube/assets"]);
if (!inventory.ok) throw inventory.error;
console.log(inventory.value.paths, inventory.value.declarations);
```

## Schema shapes

External imports and authored Packs have different identity owners. An external
source keeps importer-owned sub-asset GUIDs in its `.meta.json`; an authored
Pack keeps one `packageId` and names outputs with `sourceKey`.

### `.meta.json` -- external-asset-package

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "1.0.0",
  "kind": "external-asset-package",
    "importer": "gltf",
  "source": "<source-filename>",
  "importSettings": {},
  "subAssets": [
    { "guid": "<UUIDv7-or-UUIDv5>", "sourceIndex": 0, "kind": "mesh", "compression": "zstd" }
  ]
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> `compression?: 'none' | 'zstd'` on `PackIndexEntry` (and `subAssets[].compression`)
> indicates whether the asset's `.bin` is zstd-compressed. See
> `@forgeax/engine-codec` README for the full codec API and error codes.
> Runtime `fetchBinary` transparently decompresses when this field is `'zstd'`.
>
> **Declaring compression intent (AC-01):** set `importSettings.compression`
> (`'none' | 'zstd'`) to override the build-time default strategy for this asset
> (default: mesh -> `zstd`, texture -> `none`; `.pack.json` never compressed).
> The importer honors the override and writes the resulting `compression` onto
> the output catalog row. Omit it to accept the kind-keyed default.

### `.pack.json` -- authored Pack v3

Direct authoring names its outputs by `sourceKey`; it never stores output GUIDs:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "3.0.0",
  "packageId": "01900000-0000-7000-8000-000000000010",
  "assets": {
    "mesh/main": { "kind": "mesh", "payload": {}, "refs": [] }
  }
}
```

An instance uses the same extension and schema version, but has only its own
identity, parent, and sparse parameter values:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "3.0.0",
  "packageId": "01900000-0000-7000-8000-000000000011",
  "parent": "01900000-0000-7000-8000-000000000010",
  "values": { "count": 4 }
}
```

The two v3 branches are mutually exclusive. The build lowers them to the
runtime Pack v2 projection, whose rows contain derived GUIDs and `kind:
"internal-text-package"`; runtime still loads only that cooked projection.

### Producer provenance and topology

Authored and cooked Pack projections carry producer-owned `packageId`,
`provenance`, `revision`, and structured `diagnostics`. Asset/output rows may
declare a stable `sourceKey`; `sourceIndex` is positional evidence only. The
runtime function `diffTopology(previous, next)` preserves GUIDs by `sourceKey`,
reports additions, removals, and kind changes, and marks multi-output
source-index-only matching as ambiguous.

| Fact | Published by | Consumer rule |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `packageId` | Producer declaration | Keep stable across path or URL relocation |
| `provenance` | Producer declaration | Copy without replacing it with importer guesses |
| `revision` | Producer/DDC | Use to detect stale updates; do not silently overwrite a verified snapshot |
| `sourceKey` | Imported-output producer | Match topology only when the producer supplies a stable semantic key |
| `sourceIndex` | Imported-output producer | Display or inspect position; never use it as identity |
| `relations` / `diagnostics` | Producer facts | Preserve the complete structured values |

> [!WARNING]
> A missing `sourceKey` in a multi-output declaration is evidence insufficiency,
> not permission to hash a path or promote `sourceIndex`. Keep the result
> ambiguous and expose the repair hint.

The DDC path is also lossless: the import runner copies package-level facts to
the `.pack.json` envelope and copies each declared output's `sourceKey`,
`sourceIndex`, and relations onto the matching GUID row. The catalog builder
then projects those rows into `PackIndexEntry`; it does not create a second
authoritative fact store.

### MaterialAsset shape -- pass-based material in `.pack.json`

When `kind: 'material'`, the `payload` object carries `passes[]` + `values` (feat-20260527-material-registration-unification M3).

```json
{
  "guid": "<UUIDv7>",
  "kind": "material",
  "payload": {
    "kind": "material",
    "passes": [
      {
        "name": "Forward",
        "program": { "module": "forgeax::default-standard-pbr" }
      }
    ],
    "values": {
      "baseColor": [1.0, 0.8, 0.2],
      "metallic": 0.3
    }
  },
  "refs": []
}
```

**MaterialAsset fields in pack.json**:

| Field | Type | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `passes` | `MaterialPass[]` | Root pass descriptors; each pass names a `program.module`. |
| `parameters` | `MaterialParameter[]` | Root parameter contract used by cook and reflection. |
| `values` | `Record<string, unknown>` | Child-owned values, including per-slot texture coordinates. |
| `parent` | `AssetGuid` | Optional serialized parent edge. |

**Validation** is performed by the material schema and build-time cook. The cook resolves the parent chain, validates values and pass programs, and emits a `material-cook/4` record, artifact, references, and receipt. The receipt keeps material, source, layout, program, pipeline, publication, and cook identities together with compiler/WASM provenance and generation counters. Runtime reports a structured missing-cook error instead of compiling a material; stale generations are recooked by the producer.

## `AssetGuid` API

| Function | Signature | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `AssetGuid.parse` | `(input: string) => Result<AssetGuid, PackError>` | Parse dash-separated UUID string; returns `Ok(AssetGuid)` on success or `Err(PackError{code:'pack-guid-malformed'})` on failure. Never throws. |
| `AssetGuid.format` | `(guid: AssetGuid) => string` | Format as lowercase dash-separated UUID string |
| `AssetGuid.equals` | `(a: AssetGuid, b: AssetGuid) => boolean` | Constant-time equality |
| `AssetGuid.random` | `() => AssetGuid` | Generate a random UUIDv7 GUID |

## Unified asset commands

DevKit loads the Pack producer behind the unified `forgeax asset` command;
this package does not publish an independent executable.

| Subcommand | Description | Exit code |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `forgeax asset list --root <project> --json` | Print a bounded page (default `limit=100`, maximum 256); add `--type` and `--cursor` to continue | 0 on valid roots |
| `forgeax asset inspect --subject <guid> --root <project> --json` | Print matching asset evidence | 0 found / 1 not found |
| `forgeax asset verify --root <project> --json` | Run the fail-fast scanner and return a bounded `asset-verification-v1` source/output report | 0 clean / 1 error |

```bash
# Direct invocation (after pnpm -F @forgeax/engine-pack build)
forgeax asset list --root ./game --json
forgeax asset inspect --subject 01935f3b-aaaa-7000-8000-000000000001 --root ./game --json
forgeax asset verify --root ./game --json
```

## Scanner 7-step validation chain

The `verify` subcommand runs a fail-fast 7-step chain:

| Step | Check | Error code on failure |
|:--|:--|:--|
| 1 | Schema validation (`.meta.json` / `.pack.json` ajv) | `pack-malformed-meta` / `pack-malformed-pack` |
| 2 | GUID format check (UUIDv5/v7 dash format) | `pack-guid-malformed` |
| 3 | GUID collision detection (cross-file duplicate) | `pack-guid-collision` |
| 4 | Orphan `.meta.json` check (`.meta.json` without source file) | `pack-orphan-meta` |
| 5 | Missing `.meta.json` check (source file without sidecar) | `pack-meta-missing` |
| 6 | Subasset index bounds check (`.meta.json` subAssets[].sourceIndex) | `pack-subasset-index-out-of-range` |
| 7 | Material payload schema check (`buildMaterialAssetValidator(MATERIAL_PARAM_TYPES_V1)` for `kind: 'material'`) | `payload-schema-mismatch` |

## Mesh-binary artifact contract

`MESH_BIN_VERSION` and `MESH_BIN_HEADER_BYTES` are the Pack-owned facts for
the v5 `<guid>.bin` mesh artifact. The header carries the geometry projection
version, attribute mask, stride, digest, cardinality, and payload byte lengths;
the import encoder and assets-runtime decoder consume those facts from the
package root. Independent test fixtures may keep literal header values only as
wire-format oracles, never as a second layout table.

The 80-byte header stores `morphBytes` at offset 40; offset 44 remains zero.
Payload order is header, interleaved vertices, morph streams, indices, JSON.
V5 metadata stores `morphTargetMasks` (one to eight targets): bits 1/2/4 select
position/normal/tangent with 3/3/4 little-endian float32 components per vertex.
Bits 8/16/32 mark present channels containing only positive zero; those lanes
occupy no bytes and decode to private zero arrays. Negative zero remains in the
binary stream. Streams are target-major, then position/normal/tangent; offsets
derive from cardinality and the mask. Morph weights remain small JSON metadata. Readers reject unknown
masks, inconsistent sizes, and non-finite morph values. V4 keeps its existing
inline numeric morph metadata and has no morph byte section.

> [!WARNING]
> Producers emit v5 and readers retain v4 support. A v2/v3 artifact is
> a closed load error, not a compatibility input. Preserve the last-known-good
> catalog row, repair the source plus its `.meta.json` sidecar, then re-run the
> owning build-time importer/native cooker and `lookup/verify --guid --project
> --catalog --json` before publishing the replacement.

## Owner product and inventory contract

`scanInventory(...)` is the Pack-owned source inventory boundary. It preserves
GUID identity, source revision, source key, and source index before importer
work begins.

`finalizePackageProduct(...)` accepts the terminal producer product, validates
one receipt per GUID, validates asset-local artifact paths and bytes, and emits
the deterministic package URL and digest. Producers provide policy through the
finalizer sink; Pack owns package serialization and publication facts.

Transport finalization reuses each artifact's content hash for the source revision
and integrity descriptor within that invocation. The package digest still hashes
its canonical metadata and binary stream. No cache survives finalization: changing
input bytes before the next call must change the appropriate digests. All existing
digest and file formats are preserved; callers need no caching policy.
Canonical numeric arrays are consumed directly during hashing rather than
copied into a second array. Object-key ordering, mixed arrays and native byte
digests retain their existing serialization contract; hashing never mutates
the caller's input.

Source inventory reuses only TypeScript import syntax by the freshly computed
source-content digest. Its internal LRU is bounded by 512 entries and 16 MiB of
source bytes. Every inventory still reads and hashes files and resolves imports
again, so equal-size edits, new resolution candidates, and custom resolvers stay
authoritative. No timestamp-based freshness or caller invalidation is introduced.

## Mesh LOD relation closure

LOD is a relation inside the root mesh payload, not an independent runtime
asset kind. A valid Pack row contains the lower MeshAsset GUID in both the
payload and root `refs[]`, and the lower row is present in the same package:

```json
{
  "kind": "mesh",
  "payload": { "lods": [{ "mesh": "<lod-guid>", "screenCoverage": 0.5 }] },
  "refs": ["<lod-guid>"]
}
```

The finalizer preserves this relation while sorting rows deterministically.
Missing closure, duplicate GUIDs, invalid artifacts, or incomplete receipts
fail before publication; repair the producer and retry the same source Meta.

## Runtime program artifacts

`@forgeax/engine/pack/runtime` validates and links native JS ESM closures through
`preparePackProgram`, `verifyPackProgram`, `linkPackProgram` and `loadPackProgram`.
Preparation checks source bytes and literal module imports without executing
implementation modules. A program records an entry, selected export, module
sources, fixed Host import identities and a content digest. TypeScript conversion
belongs to the DevKit producer, before this compiler-free contract.

Browser HTTP module delivery uses the separate `@forgeax/engine/pack/runtime-browser`
entry (`prepareBrowserPackProgramScope`, `createBrowserPackProgramHost`, and
`PACK_PROGRAM_WORKER_SOURCE`). The general runtime entry remains usable by source
consumers without DOM globals.

`FixedPackPublication` keeps complete Pack/Catalog/receipt evidence and original
artifact bytes. `PackBlob` writes canonical base64 strings and reads both those
strings and previously saved numeric byte arrays. `encodePackBlob` / `decodePackBlob`
are the shared JSON boundary; artifact format, compression and integrity are unchanged.
Its optional `executions[target]` groups portable programs and
explicit tool contracts; each plugin must be covered by at least one prepared
target. A contract's GUID grants membership in that group, even with no commands.
Same GUIDs and program keys may have different artifacts across targets. Missing
coverage, unknown targets and mismatched tool realms are invalid archives.

`packProgramModuleIdentity` derives native module URLs from the complete module
graph and its declared Host bindings. Selecting another entry/export or adding
an unrelated Host capability preserves shared module state. Changing module
bytes or a declared binding creates a different module identity. The artifact
digest still covers the selected entry/export for integrity checking.

For browser delivery, the page calls `prepareBrowserPackProgramScope(workerUrl)`
and passes the returned absolute application scope to
`createBrowserPackProgramHost(scope)`. The latter works in either main or a
Dedicated Worker and writes the complete linked closure before returning its
native entry URL. Registration and page control have one bounded preparation
period; failed or late preparation cannot claim success. Host imports must use
the current realm's exact modules so component tokens and Cordis retain identity.
A Fiber disposal withdraws effects, not ESM modules; CacheStorage is not the
unique copy of authored program content.

## Entry subpaths

| Subpath | Exports |
|:--|:--|
| `.` | Re-exports from all subpaths |
| `./schema` | Compiled ajv validators for `.meta.json` and `.pack.json` |

| `./builtin` | ForgeaX namespace, synchronous `deriveBuiltin(name)`, builtin GUIDs and mesh descriptors |
| `./errors` | `PackError` class + `PackErrorCode` closed union + `PackErrorDetail` discriminated union |
| `./bridge` | `AssetRegistry` GUID bridge helpers |
| `./scanner` | File tree scanner with fail-fast 7-step validation chain |

## Plugin authoring and source transfer

`kind: 'plugin'` is a Pack output. A TypeScript source returns `{ kind, module, config?, toolContract? }`; a direct JSON Pack places these fields beneath its existing `payload`. Module locators are literal relative paths or declared npm specifiers with an optional explicit export (default is `default`). Same-file Pack plugins require named exports.

| Input | Published definition |
|:--|:--|
| packageId + sourceKey | Stable GUID |
| module specifier + export | Portable `project:...#export` or `npm:...#export` program key |
| JSON configuration | Fresh configuration per native installation |
| `toolContract` module reference or inline `ToolCommandContract` | Pure tool declarations with executor references lowered to existing program keys |
| `{ "$asset": "canonical-guid" }` | GUID string and producer-derived dependency reference |

Plugin references are derived, never hand-authored in `refs`. Configuration rejects non-finite numbers, nested undefined, functions, class instances and cycles before JSON transport. The asset decoder defers reference loading so a plugin can install a loader before consuming that loader's content.

Inline tool declarations use the same contract as a referenced declaration module.
Their executor paths are relative to the declaring Pack; a referenced contract's
executors remain relative to that module. `lowerPluginToolContract` validates and
copies declaration data, resolves executor/export pairs, and removes `exportName`
after the program key selects it. It never evaluates a module. Runtime-authored
plugins use inline declarations; module-reference contracts require producer preparation.

The build subpath exposes `collectAuthorPackClosure`: author Pack, statically declared modules/resources, Meta sidecars (including the required `.ui.html` / `.ui.css` pair) and referenced output owners, plus project WGSL module identities and transitive imports, with file digests and declared npm dependencies. Computed source-discoverable outputs are evaluated by the existing isolated Pack executor. A source that requires cooked reads is rejected for transfer with its owning path. The Pack authoring gateway delegates import/clone to DevKit's project transaction, which validates the dependency lock, complete candidate source closure, and candidate compilation. File-only cloning has been removed.

### Runtime binary data capture

`copyPackData` captures lossless metadata and owned binary views without invoking
accessors or caller serialization hooks. SharedArrayBuffer storage and typed-array
subclasses are rejected. Views retain byte offsets, lengths and backing aliases;
unreferenced backing bytes are cleared. Runtime publication uses this same capture
contract at the consuming owner boundary. Encoded Pack artifacts remain the portable
storage and transport representation, with real integrity descriptors produced only
when their bytes exist. See Import's `runtime-pack-source/2` snapshot contract for
portable source archives.

Material publication uniqueness and direct/scene-index completeness include the
color input derived from each ABI receipt. Plain and colored programs may share
a Pass/context, but each color choice must retain its own complete address pair.

The `navigation-mesh` Scriptable Pack kind carries portable baked navigation
polygons. Its explicit build-time producer is `@forgeax/engine/import/navigation-bake`;
ordinary Cook/Catalog delivery preserves the GUID and producer freshness digest.
Player loading carries no Recast compiler dependency.

## Deferred artifact delivery

An artifact may declare `delivery: 'stream'`. Finalization retains it and includes it in transport/publication identity; it still emits the complete artifact as part of the build closure. The consuming domain validates its manifest and each fetched window. Pack owns no native decoder or request scheduler. [Audio streaming](../audio-webaudio/README.md#long-audio-through-source-meta-and-guid) requires Range-capable HTTP hosting.

### Immutable build catalog transport

`pack-index.json` keeps the legacy array when its rows have no repeated complete
publication. Repeated source envelopes use `pack-index-publications/1`: `entries`
carry a `publicationIndex` into `publications`. `encodeCatalogWire` preserves every
row and every field of the complete envelope; `decodeCatalogWire` restores the
ordinary Catalog rows before existing identity, revision and scene-fence checks.
Different receipts, output sets or source revisions remain separate table entries.
The decoder returns `Result<readonly CatalogEntry[], AssetError>`; invalid
references, inline conflicts and unused table entries return the existing
`asset-parse-failed` code with the failing field and index.
Scoped live snapshots retain their existing schema and publication authority.
Use the public decoder when inspecting emitted build catalogs; the compact wire
is a transport projection, and does not grant asset readiness or skip artifact
integrity checks.
