`@forgeax/engine-net` owns the application-session vocabulary, replication
packet schema, codec limits, and structured errors. WebSocket mechanics belong
to `@forgeax/engine-net-websocket`; gameplay meaning belongs to the consumer.
Reconnect, ACK ledger, resync, packet-loss recovery, and terminal cleanup are
described by the public contract below.
Socket-specific retry or automatic recovery remains a session policy concern;
the WebSocket package only supplies the endpoint and connector mechanics.

## First entry

Use the public barrel to discover the contract:

```ts
import {
  DEFAULT_NET_RECOVERY_POLICY,
  NetSession,
  createSessionId,
  resolveNetRecoveryPolicy,
} from '@forgeax/engine-net';

const sessionId = createSessionId(17).unwrap();
const policy = resolveNetRecoveryPolicy().unwrap();
const session = new NetSession({ endpoint, maxRawMessages: 32 });
```

`SessionId` is application identity. `PeerId` is transport identity and may
change when a socket is replaced. Never use a reopened socket or a new
`PeerId` as evidence that stale local state is authoritative.

## Lifecycle contract

`NetSessionState` is a closed union owned by one logical session:

| State | Meaning | Legal next states |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `connecting` | Initial endpoint attachment is pending. | `resyncing`, `failed`, `retired` |
| `resyncing` | A transport exists, but no fresh baseline is accepted yet. | `active`, `recovering`, `failed`, `retired` |
| `active` | The current epoch and ordered projection are accepted. | `recovering`, `failed`, `retired` |
| `recovering` | The session is replacing transport state under finite bounds. | `resyncing`, `failed`, `retired` |
| `failed` | Terminal protocol, apply, or recovery failure is observable. | `retired` |
| `retired` | The session owns no further work. | `retired` |

`isLegalNetSessionTransition` checks a transition without changing state;
`isTerminalNetSessionState` names the `failed`/`retired` states whose only exit is retirement.
`transitionNetSessionState` returns a `Result`, rejects a different
`SessionId`, and reports `session-illegal-transition` instead of silently
accepting an invalid replacement.

## Replication coordinator boundary

`AuthorityCoordinator` adopts one entity-to-identity/component-signature map per `SessionId` only
when packet encoding succeeds. A failed publication consumes neither an identity
nor a tick, epoch, sequence, or component baseline. Every candidate identity is
established before any entity reference is projected.

`createReplicaCoordinator(world, profile)` consumes validated data packets and
owns the replica projection. Endpoint attachment, disconnect, retry and resource
accounting belong to `NetSession`. Unresolved cross-packet references are rejected
before World mutation; a later baseline cannot revive a deferred write.

## Finite recovery policy

`DEFAULT_NET_RECOVERY_POLICY` is deterministic and finite:

| Field | Default | Bound |
|:--|--:|:--|
| `maxSessions` | `64` | Positive safe integer |
| `maxPendingPackets` | `32` | Positive safe integer per session |
| `ackTimeoutMs` | `250` | Positive safe integer |
| `maxPacketRetries` | `3` | Positive safe integer |
| `maxReconnectAttempts` | `5` | Positive safe integer |
| `reconnectDeadlineMs` | `10000` | Positive safe integer |
| `reconnectDelaysMs` | `[0, 100, 200, 400, 800]` | Non-negative safe integers |

`resolveNetRecoveryPolicy` merges overrides and validates the complete result.
Invalid bounds return `recovery-policy-invalid` with `.detail.field` and
`.detail.reason`. No transport package selects these limits or owns a retry
ledger. `NetEndpointConnector.connect(signal)` is the only realm-neutral
replacement-endpoint capability.

## Protocol-v2 packet contract

`ReplicationPacket` is the single machine-readable wire/schema authority. Each
encoded packet begins with the fixed `FXRP2` prefix and a newline. The public
union has exactly these kinds:

| Kind | Required identity | Payload rule |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `session-open` | `sessionId`, `epoch`, `sequence: 0` | Opens an application session. |
| `session-resume` | `sessionId`, `epoch`, `sequence: 0` | Requests the same application session after transport replacement. |
| `baseline` | `sessionId`, `epoch`, `sequence: 1` | Complete authority projection; required first data packet of an epoch. |
| `delta` | `sessionId`, `epoch`, positive `sequence` | Ordered projection after the accepted baseline. |
| `ack` | `sessionId`, `epoch`, `acknowledgedSequence` | Cumulative contiguous watermark. |
| `rejection` | `sessionId`, `epoch`, `sequence` | Structured rejection of a packet kind with a reason. |

Data packets also carry the safe-integer `tick`, profile `fingerprint`, and
projected `entities`. Entity kinds are the closed `upsert` and `despawn`
union. Protocol v1, a wrong prefix, malformed fields, unsafe identity values,
an invalid baseline sequence, and limit violations fail before dispatch.

```ts
import {
  decodeReplicationPacket,
  encodeReplicationPacket,
} from '@forgeax/engine-net';

const encoded = encodeReplicationPacket(packet, profile.limits);
if (!encoded.ok) {
  // Inspect encoded.error.code, expected, hint, and narrowed detail.
  return encoded;
}
const decoded = decodeReplicationPacket(encoded.value, profile.limits);
```

`ReplicationLimits` bound message bytes, entities, component operations,
strings, buffers, and arrays. Typed arrays are represented by an allowlisted
canonical tag and revived only after validation. There is no compatibility
decoder or second batch envelope.

## Receiver visibility

Attach one synchronous receiver policy to the authority session:

```ts
import { AuthorityCoordinator, NetSession, type ReplicationVisibility } from '@forgeax/engine/net';

const visibility: ReplicationVisibility = (entity, sessionId) =>
  admittedPlayers.get(sessionId)?.visibleEntities.has(entity) ?? false;
const session = new NetSession({ endpoint, maxRawMessages: 32 });
session.attachAuthority(new AuthorityCoordinator(world, profile), visibility);
```

The policy is pure game code and runs once per Profile candidate per receiver per
publication. It only narrows the Profile query. Read current ownership, team,
distance, or explicit visibility facts there; no renderer or camera state is
required. Omitting the policy selects all Profile entities for every receiver.

| Change | Packet and replica result |
|:--|:--|
| Initial connection | Replica announces its logical identity automatically; every authority waits for that announcement before evaluating or sending data. Each receiver starts with its own sequence-one baseline, including an empty baseline. |
| Becomes visible | Complete component upsert with a fresh receiver-local network identity. |
| Remains visible | Changed-component delta; component removal retains the ordinary removal operation. |
| Becomes hidden | Despawn in that receiver's delta; other receivers keep their own state. |
| Hidden reference | With a visibility policy, scalar references outside the visible Profile become `null`, and those array entries are removed; revealing a target restores references in the same packet. Without a policy, the existing unresolved-reference rejection remains. |
| Late join or explicit resync | Full current baseline for that receiver; established peers retain their epochs and deltas. |
| Authority or policy reattachment | Every connected receiver receives a newly evaluated baseline at a newer epoch, so an already accepted stream cannot retain revoked entities. |
| Transport replacement | Disconnect drops that receiver's signatures and ACK ledger. Replica clearing resets ordering; the replacement announces the same `SessionId` and receives a newly evaluated baseline at the resume epoch. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Logical identity announcement is routing, not authentication. The game's
> admission policy owns trusted player identities. Two live announced peers
> cannot attach the same `SessionId`; the rejected announcement leaves the
> current attachment intact.

`AuthorityCoordinator.publish(sessionId, visibility)` and
`publishFull(sessionId, visibility)` expose the same projection for direct
consumers. `idFor(entity, sessionId)` reads its receiver-local network identity;
`forgetSession(sessionId)` releases direct-consumer state. `resumeSession(sessionId, epoch)` starts a fresh projection at a monotonic
recovery epoch. Session integration
owns that release automatically on disconnect, replacement, failure and disposal.
A full resync bumps only that receiver's epoch. Encoding failure adopts no
candidate identity, sequence, tick or component signature.

ACKs must match the sending transport peer, logical session, current epoch and
published sequence. A stale or foreign ACK cannot drain another peer's ledger.
`maxPendingPackets` bounds each receiver independently; a stalled receiver
returns ordinary backpressure while healthy peers still publish. A transport
write failure schedules a new baseline before that receiver's next delta.

`getReplicationSnapshot()` is the authority's per-peer diagnostic roster
(`peerId`, `sessionId`, `epoch`, `sequence`, `acknowledgedSequence`,
`pendingPackets`). Its rows are independent sequence spaces.
`getRecoverySnapshot()` retains single-session recovery evidence; for an authority,
`pendingPackets` is the largest peer backlog, `acknowledgedSequence` is the smallest
peer watermark, and `ownedResources.ledgers` counts nonempty peer ledgers. Its
`epoch`/`sequence` describe the last sent publication; use the roster to diagnose
individual receivers.

Run the receiver regression and real-socket checks, then the optional performance
consumer after building the package closure:

```bash
pnpm --filter @forgeax/engine-net exec vitest run --config vitest.config.ts
pnpm --filter @forgeax/engine-net-websocket exec vitest run --config vitest.config.ts
node packages/net/__tests__/fixtures/peer-visibility-performance.mjs artifacts/g25 <baseline-sha>
```

The diagnostic compares the exact baseline coordinator/codec source with the
current built barrel: 128/512 entities, 1/8/32 receivers, 100%/25%/10% visibility,
40 warmup and 100 measured alternating AB/BA samples. It records CPU and wall
p50/p95, exact outgoing bytes and raw samples. Each entity's `x` changes every publication;
World writes are outside the timed interval, encoding is inside, sockets and
replica application are outside. This measures publication, not whole-game FPS
or network round-trip latency. All-visible publication performs independent
receiver projection and encoding; bandwidth savings require a smaller visible
set. Hardware timings are diagnostic evidence, not a portable CI threshold.

## Structured failure and recovery guidance

Expected failures are `Result` values with `.code`, `.expected`, `.hint`, and
code-narrowed `.detail`. Branch on the code; do not parse error messages.

| Code | Meaning | Next action |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `protocol-unsupported-version` | The peer sent a version other than `2`. | Align the peer build before sending bytes. |
| `session-illegal-transition` | A state replacement is not legal for this session. | Wait for the current state or retire the session. |
| `recovery-policy-invalid` | A configured bound is invalid. | Fix the named field and resolve the policy again. |
| `recovery-rejected` | The authority rejected recovery. | Inspect `.detail.reason`, then dispose or fix admission. |
| `recovery-exhausted` | Finite attempts or deadline were exhausted. | Inspect accounting and create a new session only after terminal retirement. |
| `apply-invariant-failed` | Validated ECS application failed. | Treat the coordinator as terminal; never retry the fatal apply. |

The session snapshot shape is `NetRecoverySnapshot`: it reports `state`, the
stable `sessionId`, `pendingPackets`, `maxPendingPackets`,
`acknowledgedSequence`, `epoch`, `sequence`, `reconnectAttempts`, the latest
structured error, and `ownedResources`. `ownedResources` counts pending
connects, timers, ledgers, and callbacks; every terminal and disposed path
must report zero. `NetRecoveryOutcome` gives stable results for repeated
recovery calls: `started`, `already-recovering`, `already-active`, or `retired`.

## Runnable public evidence

Run the built public-barrel consumers from the repository root:

```bash
node packages/net/__tests__/fixtures/protocol-v2-consumer.mjs
node packages/net/__tests__/fixtures/recovery-session-consumer.mjs
```

The protocol fixture round-trips every packet kind and rejects protocol v1.
The recovery fixture checks every lifecycle state, transition validation,
bounded defaults, and deterministic memory endpoint behavior. These fixtures
import only the shipped `@forgeax/engine-net` barrel.

## Existing ECS replication seam

`defineReplication` selects the portable ECS query, ordered component list,
limits, and profile fingerprint. `AuthorityCoordinator` publishes baseline and
delta `ReplicationPacket` data; `ReplicaCoordinator` validates profile,
identity, ordering, schema, and same-packet references before World mutation.
Local ECS `EntityHandle` values never cross the wire.

```ts
import {
  AuthorityCoordinator,
  ReplicaCoordinator,
  defineReplication,
} from '@forgeax/engine-net';
```

Immediate unresolved-reference rejection remains the one policy: a reference
must already exist or be created in the same data packet. No cross-packet
reference queue is retained.

`ReplicaCoordinator.lastPacketOutcome` is the explicit packet-order result:
`accepted`, `duplicate`, or `ignored-old-epoch`. A duplicate returns success
without World mutation; an old epoch returns success without reviving work; a
gap or invalid new baseline returns a structured error before mutation. The
coordinator never closes a transport. `NetSession` owns endpoint closure,
terminal failure, connector cancellation, and plugin teardown.
