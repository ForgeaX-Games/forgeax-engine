## Explicit DDC lifecycle contract

### Development publication

Virtual modules are invalidated after an accepted rebind, while page refresh
remains the existing optional host callback. Generated asset declarations use
the resolved Vite root and are replaced only when their content changes.

The host owns project identity and injects both DDC roots. The plugin does not
derive a root from the working directory, an asset root, a game basename, or a
URL:

```ts
pluginPack({
  roots: ['assets/scene.pack.json', 'assets/player.pack.ts', 'assets/fire.vfx.wgsl'],
  ddc: {
    buildCacheRoot: '/workspace/.forgeax/ddc/build-cache',
    projectDdcRoot: '/game/.forgeax/ddc/v2',
  },
});
```

`buildCacheRoot` is the optional build producer cache. Build-only consumers may
omit it; publication remains fail-open and still emits the authoritative Pack
and Meta outputs. `projectDdcRoot` is required for dev publication, runtime
scope binding, fixed-root rebinding, and recovery. A missing project root is a
closed structured error, never a fallback to `cwd` or `roots[0]`.

The project root is the only home for v2 project lifecycle state. The Engine
DDC lifecycle owns leases, candidate generations, `current`, `lastKnownGood`,
discard, close, and crash recovery. The plugin remains the single Pack owner:
Catalog rows, Pack v2 bodies, Meta, receipts, and artifact closure are
published as one validated producer result. `current` is the active verified
publication; `lastKnownGood` is read-only recovery evidence and is never
silently promoted or shipped. `runtimeBinding` carries the active scope and
generation to the browser consumer. Closing or rebinding a host releases the
old lease and cannot publish a discarded candidate.

External Meta imports use the same publication boundary in dev mode. The Pack
finalizer returns the complete artifact closure, including each producer MIME
type; the live artifact transport map is updated only after the DDC publication
is accepted. A staged production candidate owns disposable Pack and artifact
maps until its outer generation commits. Failed, aborted, or discarded
candidates therefore leave the accepted Catalog, Pack body, artifact bytes,
and imported GUID set available for the next same-source retry.

The Node-only `http-artifact` entry prepares gzip level-1 HTTP representations
serially before dev readiness and generation commit. Representations are weakly
owned by the accepted raw byte bodies; they do not replace Pack artifacts or
their decoded-byte integrity. HTTP responses only select prepared bodies, honor
`Accept-Encoding` quality values, merge `Vary`, and retain identity for HEAD and
byte-range requests. Unprepared, unprofitable, or failed encodings serve the
original bytes when identity is acceptable; otherwise the response is 406 with
an empty body. Existing HTTP encodings must also be acceptable to the client.
Encoding failures emit a warning instead of retrying per request.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> HTTP compression is a lossless delivery representation. It does not establish
> frame-time, scene-readiness, or visual-quality acceptance.

After a process restart, dev transport may rebuild its in-memory Pack and
artifact maps from the matching `current` DDC entry when the complete closure
is present. This is a read-through cache warm-up only: an incomplete or
non-current entry falls back to the declared producer, while `lastKnownGood`
and `stale` entries remain unavailable for serving.

Consumers should pass the same explicit `ddc` object to every plugin entry
point. Do not add legacy, v1, compatibility, basename, or URL fallback paths.

## Native authored Pack cookers

### Public ScriptablePack consumer contract

`SCRIPTABLE_PACK_CAPABILITY_MANIFEST` publishes the 17 durable kinds and the
three Host capability boundaries. Dev and production use the same Pack v2,
Catalog, payload, `refs`, `artifacts`, receipts, and structured recovery
fields; only the transport locator changes. Do not add a sidecar fallback for
a valid ScriptablePack GUID.

The ordered durable matrix is `mesh`, `material`, `scene`, `texture`,
`equirect`, `sampler`, `font`, `render-pipeline`, `tileset`, `video`,
`skeleton`, `skin`, `animation-clip`, `animation-graph`, `audio`, and
`particle-effect`, and `ies-profile`; its SSOT is `SCRIPTABLE_PACK_ASSET_KINDS` in
`@forgeax/engine-pack`.

### ScriptablePack publication

A `terrain` ScriptablePack output supplies a validated `TerrainSource`. The terrain producer derives subsection meshes, height/control mips and Standard material arrays as one GUID-linked closure; the existing Pack cook, Catalog and runtime loader own publication. See [the terrain contract](../terrain/README.md) for bounds and layer semantics.

Development publication acquires a fresh source lease only when the worklist
builds that source or instance. One recyclable worker serves the serial
worklist; each retry reloads the module, and the whole pool closes on either
publication success or failure. Inventory keeps metadata, not pending worker
leases. Module/build timeouts and accepted-publication recovery remain unchanged.

Standalone production follows the same execution-time lease ownership and
passes its inventory source snapshot to the producer. See [Pack worker
ownership](../pack/README.md) for the captured-source and cleanup contract.

Custom Material outputs use the host's registered `material` NativeCooker in
both dev and build. Its transitive WGSL paths participate in the same watcher
closure and its fingerprint participates in the same publication identity.
No Pack source edit is required to notice a WGSL-only change.

After a failed rebuild, the scoped Catalog reports degraded authority and its
diagnostics while preserving accepted entries and bytes. New lazy imports are
fenced; explicit `x-forgeax-import-mode: rebuild` requests and already-published
asset URLs remain usable for recovery. A degraded rebuild scan fails the production
transaction before publication, including scans that return diagnostics without
throwing. Its HMR delta carries diagnostics with empty identity changes, so a
failed scan cannot remove accepted rows. Unknown asset URLs cannot start new
production through this exception. Initial startup failure serves a structured failure until a watcher rebuild
accepts a complete inventory; it creates no accepted empty snapshot. After
repair, GUID materialization uses that accepted generation rather than the
cached first startup result. Expired runtime generations remain closed. An external Meta importer can instead publish one
failed row while unrelated rows remain authoritative. Its row diagnostics are
the rejection signal, and the watcher retains the current page so consumers can
keep their last accepted payload and recover in place.

Repeated scoped Catalog reads reuse one serialized body per accepted projection
and runtime binding. Lazy publications, changed diagnostics and scope changes
invalidate that body; the request freshness barrier still runs before reuse.

`pluginPack({ roots })` automatically inventories trusted `*.pack.ts` sources. The production defaults compose the standard output registry and a fixed staged generation; hosts inject only roots, importers, native cookers, runtime binding, refresh, and DDC policy. A bounded authored build timeout is returned as the structured build-phase failure and the generation keeps its previous Catalog/Pack publication until a corrected source succeeds. Scanner/Catalog projection reads only the validated definition; explicit cook calls `build`, finalizes all outputs into one Pack v2 transaction, publishes one receipt per output GUID, and stores canonical Meta as `scriptable-pack.meta.json` in that package.

Development serializes watcher rebuilds and explicit imports through the
same production session, so independent lazy publications retain each other's
Catalog, Pack and artifact changes. Close aborts active work and drains queued
requests before the session releases ownership. Every rebuild inventories all
configured roots; a request GUID never narrows the authoritative inventory.

Dev and build share one scanner inventory and one bounded producer session. The
inventory contains canonical declaration identity, producer kind, projected
outputs/external GUIDs, closure digests, and diagnostics; Catalog projection
and the GUID-to-Meta watcher index consume it without reopening the source. Dev
registers owners and materializes on demand or before consume; production
materializes every owner through that same session. Content cycles fail
structurally. Successful rebuilds replace the complete generation, while a
failed watch rebuild leaves the previously installed Catalog and Pack bodies
current. Relative TypeScript, JavaScript, and JSON helpers enter the source
fingerprint through the Pack inventory. A scene-producing definition must
declare its `sceneComponents`; the producer binds that schema to the
definition's output only, so missing fields fail closed without a global ECS
roster. Runtime consumes only Catalog, Pack v2, and artifacts.

An authored `.pack.json` may be runtime `direct` or `cooked`; the filename does
not decide this. Register native producers at the app composition root so the
same producer runs in dev and build mode:

```ts
pluginPack({
  roots: ['assets/effects.pack.json', 'assets/effects.vfx.wgsl'],
  cookers: [particleEffectCooker],
});
```

For a `cooked` asset row, the cooker owns the runtime payload, dependency refs,
and artifact bytes. The plugin validates and finalizes that product before it
publishes the catalog row as `internal-asset + cooked + current`. A cooked row
without a registered producer is a build/dev error; raw authored payload must
never silently reach the runtime loader.

| Authored row | Producer output | Catalog after successful cook |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `execution: 'direct'` | authored payload | `internal-asset + direct + current` |
| `execution: 'cooked'` | runtime payload + refs + artifacts | `internal-asset + cooked + current` |

## Authoring and recovery index

The audit input and category conclusions live in [`schemas/asset-authority.schema.json`](../../schemas/asset-authority.schema.json); the executable gate is [`check-asset-authority-audit.mjs`](../../scripts/forgeax/check-asset-authority-audit.mjs). This plugin projects producer facts into Catalog rows. It does not become the author authority, DDC owner, or Editor write gateway.

| Need | Entry | Safe action |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Inspect | `buildCatalogResult()` and Catalog JSON | Branch on `authority`, `diagnostics`, and lifecycle fields |
| Rebuild | Declared importer or native cooker | Re-run the producer and publish only validated output |
| Preview LKG | Explicit evidence locator | Keep `lastKnownGood` read-only and out of shipped output |
| Stop publish | Degraded authority or failed lifecycle | Block the release and follow the diagnostic recovery |

## Producer fields are catalog facts

The build producer copies `packageId`, `provenance`, `revision`,
`sourceKey`/`sourceIndex`, typed `relations`, and structured `diagnostics`
from pack/meta declarations into every emitted `CatalogEntry`. It supplies a
fallback provenance version from the producer schema when a sidecar omits one;
consumers never need to guess importer identity from a URL or file suffix.

> [!IMPORTANT]
The producer result contains `entries`, `authority`, and structured
`diagnostics`. It is the only Catalog truth; a failed or degraded inventory is
a structured failure and cannot emit a partial build index.

| Result field | Meaning | Safe consumer action |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `entries` | Complete neutral catalog rows | Read producer facts and merge by lowercase GUID |
| `authority: 'authoritative'` | Scan and fold completed with verified inputs | Apply the snapshot or delta |
| `authority: 'degraded'` | Some roots or declarations could not be verified | Keep affected subjects isolated and follow diagnostics |
| `diagnostics` | Structured scan/fold evidence | Branch on `code`, `expected`, `actual`, and `hint` |

`packageId` is the topology group identity. `sourcePath`, `relativeUrl`, and
DDC locations are replaceable locators; they are never used as a fallback
identity. Revision and producer facts remain attached to every row in a
catalog delta, including a row whose locator changed.
## AssetEvidence producer boundary

The plugin publishes catalog navigation, not proof. A row's `packageUrl` and optional `cookReceiptUrl` are joined with the producer source meta, `CookReceipt`, and Pack v2 artifact verification by the pack CLI or runtime SDK as `AssetEvidence`. Dev and build paths should preserve the same locator semantics so diagnostics do not depend on HMR.

When source bytes change, keep the evidence state explicit: `notCooked`, `ready/current`, `ready/stale`, or `unknown`; package/artifact checks are `notChecked`, `passed`, or `failed`. Recover by fixing the source/cook producer and rerunning `lookup/verify --guid --project --catalog --json`, not by inventing a replacement catalog row.

# Catalog transport and host refresh

`watch: false` freezes a development catalog session. DevKit uses it while compiling a replacement plugin session; its Vite watcher owns the eventual full reload. Ordinary Pack hosts retain source watching by default. Changed-source requests cannot refresh a frozen catalog in place.

> [!IMPORTANT]
`pluginPack` publishes a typed Catalog delta through the scoped Vite channel. A
`CatalogDelta` says which rows were added, changed, or removed; it does not
decide whether a host reloads. Hosts that need a reload on ordinary successful
edits opt in explicitly.

Repeated file notifications for an already accepted authored publication keep
the Catalog authoritative when its source/output tuple is unchanged. The
producer validates that tuple; watcher timing alone cannot establish a revision
conflict. Rows without publication evidence retain the Catalog revision guard.

Recovery from a degraded watcher generation has a mandatory refresh: once an
authoritative rebuild succeeds, the plugin sends `full-reload` to every Vite
server configured on that plugin, even if the repaired source restores the
same Catalog revision or the host supplies an empty `refresh` callback. Failed
rebuilds keep the current page. Independent plugin instances retain their own
server sets.

The browser adapter is `createCatalogClient(enumerate, import.meta.hot)`. It
provides the browser-side subscription and enumeration pair; the application
keeps one Catalog owner and does not import Vite into the runtime. Subscribe
before requesting the initial snapshot, then merge `added`, `changed`, and
`removed` by stable GUID. Consult the exported `CatalogEntry` and
`CatalogDelta` types in `@forgeax/engine-types` for the schema rather than
reproducing it here.

```ts
import type { CatalogDelta, CatalogEntry } from '@forgeax/engine-types';
import { createCatalogClient } from '@forgeax/engine-vite-plugin-pack/catalog-client';

const rowsByGuid = new Map<string, CatalogEntry>();

function mergeRows(rows: readonly CatalogEntry[]): void {
  for (const row of rows) rowsByGuid.set(row.guid.toLowerCase(), row);
}

function mergeDelta(delta: CatalogDelta): void {
  for (const guid of delta.removed) rowsByGuid.delete(guid.toLowerCase());
  mergeRows(delta.added);
  mergeRows(delta.changed);
}

const client = createCatalogClient(
  () => assets.enumerateCatalog(),
  import.meta.hot,
);

const stop = assets.subscribeCatalog(mergeDelta);

async function reconcileCatalog(): Promise<void> {
  const snapshot = await assets.enumerateCatalog();
  if (!snapshot.ok) {
    console.error(snapshot.error.code, snapshot.error.hint);
    return;
  }
  mergeRows(snapshot.value);
}

await reconcileCatalog();
// Call reconcileCatalog() again after a late subscription or transport interruption.

// Call from the host's teardown / unmount path, not after setup.
function disposeCatalog(): void {
  stop();
}
```

The Vite client contributes the HMR subscription and a structured failure
result. The application keeps only its derived `rowsByGuid` view: apply every
delta as removals followed by complete row replacements, and merge each
successful snapshot into that same view. On a late subscription or interrupted
transport, call `reconcileCatalog()` again. Keep the subscription alive until
the host's teardown or unmount path calls `disposeCatalog()`.

Engine app composition roots that require a full refresh for watched asset
content declare that choice directly:

```ts
import { pluginPack, reloadAssetHost } from '@forgeax/engine-vite-plugin-pack';

pluginPack({ roots: ['assets'], refresh: reloadAssetHost() });
```

This policy also covers source-only byte changes, which deliberately do not
become fake catalog-row changes. A static build has no HMR stream: enumeration
still works from its catalog, while subscription is a safe no-op. If a client
subscribed late or reconnects, re-enumerate and reconcile by GUID rather than
inventing a Vite replay guarantee.

# Pack-index entry shape (SSOT: `PackIndexEntry` in `@forgeax/engine-types`)

Each row in `pack-index.json` (build) or the scoped dev Catalog carries:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `guid` | `string` (UUIDv5/v7 lowercase) | asset identity |
| `packageUrl` | `string` | dev: scoped runtime locator from `runtimeBinding`; build: hashed Rollup artifact |
| `kind` | `string` (closed disc.) | `'texture'` / `'mesh'` / `'scene'` / `'material'` / future arms |
| `sourcePath` | `string` | on-disk source path (debugging + grep; build retains source JPG path even though `packageUrl` points to import artefact) |
| `metadata` | `ImageMetadata \| undefined` | present iff `kind === 'texture'`; sub-structure: `width?` / `height?` / `format: GPUTextureFormat` / `colorSpace: 'srgb' \| 'linear'` / `mipmap: boolean`; `width` / `height` may be absent in dev-mode entries pre-decode (build-mode import fills them) |
| `packageId`, `provenance`, `revision` | producer PODs | stable facts copied from the declaration; absent means no evidence was published |
| `sourceKey`, `sourceIndex` | topology PODs | semantic key plus positional evidence; `sourceIndex` is never identity |
| `relations`, `diagnostics` | structured facts | copied into the row and consumed by property, not message parsing |

`metadata.mipmap` is the boolean form; sidecar `*.meta.json` `importSettings.mipmap` string tokens `'auto'` / `'none'` are mapped at the catalog builder (feat-20260517-vite-plugin-image-build-time-cook D-5; runtime is unaware of the string form). 5-field shape is feat-20260517-vite-plugin-image-build-time-cook D-2 (charter P4 consistent abstraction; metadata field names mirror `TextureAsset` POD byte-for-byte).

## Dev and build semantics

`producerReadiness: 'before-consume'` materializes every required declaration
before a consumer can load it. `'on-demand'` keeps the inventory discoverable
and materializes the owning declaration at the first GUID request. Both modes
use the same producer and finalizer; an absent importer, cooker, or source
dependency returns a structured failure and never invents a raw runtime row.

A failed startup or failed Pack session returns HTTP 500 with the original
producer diagnostic. Starting and transitioning sessions keep HTTP 503.
Callers therefore stop polling an already failed producer without spending a
second startup deadline. Repair and reopen the project explicitly.

Catalog diagnostics and HTTP failures retain a bounded, JSON-safe `cause`
projection, including nested producer codes, source paths, and module diagnostics.
Only the named diagnostic fields cross this boundary; arbitrary objects and
stacks are omitted. Inspect these fields before repairing the owning source.

The `runtimeBinding` identifies the active scope and generation for dev
transport. A late request from an old generation is rejected, and a failed
rebuild serves only the previous accepted publication. `lastKnownGood` remains
read-only evidence; `preview-LKG` is an explicit inspection action, never a
build input. Build mode always materializes all required declarations and emits
only the accepted Pack v2 publication. A host that needs live updates uses
`createCatalogClient` with the plugin's scoped Catalog stream; runtime asset
loading stays on the one Catalog/Pack reader path.
# Static asset evidence

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Static assets publish as Pack v2 and are navigated by `packageUrl`; runtime-only bytes remain a separate exception.

The derived `AssetEvidence` view joins catalog navigation, cook receipt freshness, and artifact verification. Discover it with `lookup/verify --guid --project --catalog --json`; `notCooked`, `stale`, and `unknown` require different recovery actions.

## Indexed producer recovery

This is the shortest path from a catalog symptom to a producer repair:

1. **Inspect** the catalog row, source Meta, DDC head, receipt, and Pack
   verification together. Branch on structured `code`, `detail`, `expected`,
   and `hint`; do not classify a row from a URL suffix or log string.
2. **Repair the producer boundary** named by `detail.stage`: register the
   declared importer, repair source or Meta, or remove an invalid derived DDC
   entry. The source package plus Meta remains the author authority.
3. **Rebuild or cold-cook** the source package through the registered importer
   or native cooker. The producer finalizer is the only writer of the DDC
   product and Pack body.
4. **Verify** the new receipt, package digest, artifacts, and Catalog
   lifecycle. A `lastKnownGood` product is read-only evidence, not current
   output.
5. **Retry** the same GUID only after verification passes. A failed producer
   attempt must not be hidden by a raw-source or custom-mesh fallback.

`producerReadiness: 'before-consume'` requires every source-package importer
or native cooker needed by the scanned Meta declarations before a consumer can
load the row. `producerReadiness: 'on-demand'` still requires the `pluginPack`
producer registration and the host's Catalog client/refresh wiring. Missing
either side is a structured producer failure, not permission for runtime
compilation.

The plugin owns Catalog projection and dev/build transport projection. It does not own
source authoring, DDC persistence policy, runtime payload semantics, or Editor
write operations. Those boundaries remain in the source package, producer,
assets-runtime, and asset-authoring gateway respectively.

## Idle revision probes

Native watcher hints reconcile immediately. The missed-event probe waits after
snapshot completion for `max(probeMs, min(snapshotMs * 10, 60000))` milliseconds,
so expensive filesystem walks do not continuously occupy the dev server. The
60-second bound applies to the wait, not to snapshot or cook execution time.
`drain()` requests a fresh snapshot even when an earlier crawl is in flight,
so writes preceding the call are observed without waiting for the next probe
deadline. Shutdown cancels the timer and awaits in-flight work.

### Cold import publication

Development imports request the terminal product without a preliminary Pack.
The shared transport finalizer projects that product once for publication;
source sampling and GUID closure are unchanged. Cook finalization and recovery
fences retain their existing owners.

A development generation queues validated ImportPublication inputs while source owners finish their Cook work. The outer commit acquires and commits each DDC lease immediately; a slow synchronous shader Cook for another source therefore cannot expire an earlier source's lease. Candidate Catalog and artifact maps remain private until the complete generation succeeds. Failed commits restore the already committed DDC candidates through their existing CAS fences and discard the remaining queued inputs.

The `navigation-mesh` Scriptable Pack kind carries portable baked navigation
polygons. Its explicit build-time producer is `@forgeax/engine/import/navigation-bake`;
ordinary Cook/Catalog delivery preserves the GUID and producer freshness digest.
Player loading carries no Recast compiler dependency.
