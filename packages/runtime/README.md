# `@forgeax/engine-runtime`

This file documents the Runtime ownership unit. Game authors install the
umbrella `@forgeax/engine` package and use its public facades, such as
`@forgeax/engine/runtime`, `@forgeax/engine/app`, and
`@forgeax/engine/render`; the physical `@forgeax/engine-*` names below are for
repository source and package tests.

## Adaptive resolution

Runtime's default device admission enables supported timestamps for late camera
DRS requests without allocating query resources. Author `DynamicResolution`
beside a TAA Camera and inspect `renderer.inspect().dynamicResolution`; the
[Render contract](../render/README.md#adaptive-dynamic-resolution) owns controller
policy, fallback, bounds and successful-submit dimensions. Runtime owns no
second resolution controller or CPU frame-time fallback.

For spatial SMAA, use `Camera.antialias: ANTIALIAS_SMAA`; the
[Render SMAA contract](../render/README.md#smaa) owns its quality, ordering and
Browser/Dawn/RHI Debug verification path.

## Host entry and frame evidence

`createRenderer` is the host assembly entry. It selects the backend services
and returns the render package's single `Renderer` contract; game code does
not construct a device, graph, or second submit path. Pass the attached lease,
camera, and environment facts to `draw`, then bind diagnostics to the
returned `FrameReceipt`:

```ts
const result = await createRenderer(canvas);
if (!result.ok) throw result.error;
const renderer = result.value;
const lease = renderer.attach(world);
if (!lease.ok) throw lease.error;
const frame = renderer.draw({
  leases: [lease.value],
  camera: { lease: lease.value },
  environment: { lease: lease.value },
});
if (!frame.ok) throw frame.error;
const facts = renderer.inspect();
const observation = await renderer.observe(frame.value, { include: ['timings'] });
const output = facts.output;
// output.autoExposure / output.standardLut are receipt-bound detached facts.
// Read output.error before choosing a retry or producer recovery path.
void facts;
void output;
void observation;
```

The public runtime factory resolves only after its internal initialization
chain succeeds. The lower-level render construction seam retains the
`initialization` Promise for package-owned tests and adapters; callers of
`createRenderer()` use the returned `Result` as the readiness barrier.

`Renderer.inspect().output` is the single public subtree for the Standard
output transform: it contains display encoding, surface formats, the auto
exposure receipt, the ordinary shared-texture 3D LUT receipt, and structured
availability errors. Camera exposure and color grading remain authored on the
Camera; runtime only assembles the renderer and forwards the detached facts.

For renderer-wide active/candidate/retiring graph allocation facts and their
recovery interpretation, follow the [`render` allocation inspection guide](../render/README.md#renderer-wide-graph-allocation-inspection).

## Bloom forwarding and inspection

Runtime forwards the Camera Bloom fields unchanged to the Render owner; it
does not construct a second post-process graph or retain Bloom GPU handles.
The enabled Standard path is the bounded five-level `D0..D4` downsample,
`U3..U0` tent upsample, and HDR composite chain. `Camera.bloom ===
BLOOM_DISABLED`, `bloomIntensity === 0`, or an ineligible `tonemap` keeps the
path at exact zero work; Bloom is admitted only when the existing HDR/tone
output path is active.

Read `renderer.inspect().bloom` for detached level dimensions, pass counts,
compiled target bytes, resident child bytes, generation, and active/retiring
state. These values are descriptor-derived and invalid graphs fail closed;
they are not inferred from the canvas size. Browser/Dawn readback and visual
PNG evidence remain separate from this structural inspection.

## Progressive recovery index

Start with the public recovery route: `state() -> inspect() -> recover() ->
FrameReceipt`. Only an `alive` Renderer accepts `World.update` plus `draw`.
`device-lost` and `recovering` keep the host alive while freezing simulation
and submit; concurrent `recover()` calls share one flight. A `faulted` Renderer
must be disposed and recreated, while `disposed` is terminal. After recovery,
retry the identical draw input and bind `observe(receipt, request)` to its new
receipt and device generation.

Use the closed `error.code` with `expected`, `hint`, and typed `detail` to
choose waiting, an explicit retry, repairing the named producer/capability, or
rebuilding the Renderer. Do not parse text or reach into graph, device, or
history state. Target and history identities survive, but new contents remain
uninitialized until a successful new-generation receipt; fallback output is
not Browser/Dawn proof. Structural inspection, real Browser/Dawn readback,
and PNG evidence remain separate evidence classes.

Before the first `attach` or `draw`, await `createRenderer()` and branch on its
returned `Result`; the public `Renderer` value is ready after that check. A
failed construction is either an `EngineEnvironmentError`, which reports that
no usable backend was admitted through `reason` and `detail`, or a `RenderError`
from the Render construction boundary. For a `RenderError`, branch on its
closed `code`; inspect a typed `detail` only for variants that define one.
`renderer-contract-failed` carries the failed `operation` and a string `cause`.
Do not traverse nested backend objects. Use `renderer.recover()` only after a
`Renderer` has been admitted.

```ts
import { createRenderer, EngineEnvironmentError } from '@forgeax/engine-runtime';

const result = await createRenderer(canvas);
if (!result.ok) {
  const error = result.error;
  if (error instanceof EngineEnvironmentError) {
    repairBackend(error.reason, error.detail);
  } else if (error.code === 'renderer-contract-failed') {
    repairRendererOwner(error.detail.operation, error.detail.cause);
  } else {
    repairRendererOwner(error.code, error.hint);
  }
  throw error;
}
const renderer = result.value;
```

Carrier manifests and schemas expose current source/build provenance, backend,
runner, and frame identity. Structural graph checks are distinct from real
Browser/Dawn readback and PNG evidence; a historical oracle is reference data,
not a runtime pass. `unavailable` remains an explicit result.

`inspect()` is detached and bounded. `observe()` is receipt-bound, so a
stale receipt is a structured failure rather than an implicit read of the
current frame. Repair the owner named by `error.detail`, then retry the same
request.

## GPU-driven PBR / shadow / skin navigation

Runtime is the host-side entry for the prepared Standard PBR frame. Follow the
owner links when a frame is rejected:

| Entry | Owner | Next action |
|:--|:--|:--|
| [`shader`](../shader/README.md#gpu-driven-pbr--shadow--skin-navigation) | WGSL, schema, reflection, cooked receipt | repair source or recook |
| [`render`](../render/README.md#gpu-driven-pbr--shadow--skin-navigation) | scene index, topology, shadow views, indirect record | inspect lane and retry |
| [`hello-skin`](../../apps/hello/skin/README.md#gpu-driven-skin-carrier) / [`hello-fbx-skin`](../../apps/hello/fbx-skin/README.md#gpu-driven-fbx-carrier) | imported skin carrier and smoke | rerun the declared smoke |

The offline exercise is deterministic: read `renderer.inspect().renderScene.gpuDriven`,
branch on the closed `lane`/`reason`, and for a blocked channel use
`failure.detail.owner` plus `failure.detail.recovery` to repair the named
producer before retrying the unchanged frame request. `failure.hint` is
human-readable only. `blocked/resource-not-ready` means promotion stopped; it
is not permission to route the same candidate through CPU semantics.

## Directional shadow authoring and recovery index

The cold-AI entry is `DirectionalLight.shadowFilter`, followed by one read of
`renderer.inspect().directionalShadow` read. The closed labels are
`pcf1`, `pcf3`, `pcf5`, `pcssMedium`, and `pcssHigh`; the default is `pcf3`.
`shadowAngularRadius` is measured in radians, defaults to `0.00465`, and must
be in `[0.0001, 0.05]`. `maxPenumbraTexels` is a finite integer measured in
texels, defaults to `32`, and must be in `[1, 64]`. These are Directional
author facts; Point/Spot `pcfKernelSize` remains a separate contract.

The detached `directionalShadow` projection explains the next action without
reading renderer private state:

| Inspection field | AI interpretation |
|:--|:--|
| `requested` / `effective` | Author request and admitted profile |
| `status` | `accepted`, explicit `fallback`, or `rejected` |
| `fallbackReason` | `webgl2-unsupported`, `rhi-null-structural`, or `candidate-failed` |
| `lastKnownGood` | Whether the previous admitted profile was retained |
| `pixelEvidence` | `available` or `not-available`; structural evidence is not pixel proof |
| `deviceGeneration` / `graphGeneration` | 当前 inspection result 的 generation identity |
| `cascadeCount`, `mapSize`, `shadowMapBytes`, `writerPasses`, `blockerTaps`, `filterTapUpperBound`, `seamTapUpperBound` | Bounded CSM and tap-budget facts |

For `error.code === 'shadow-invalid-config'`, use the structured properties
`error.expected`, `error.hint`, and `error.detail.field`, `actual`, `bound`, and
`reason`. Set the named field to the bound described by `detail`, then retry;
the prose `error.message` is not an API. For a failed capable candidate, keep
the `lastKnownGood` projection, repair or rebuild its producer, call
`renderer.recover()`, and retry the identical draw. WebGL2 may expose only its
explicit PCF fallback, while RhiNull is structural (`pixelEvidence:
not-available`); neither state may be rewritten as PCSS support. A
`not-run` Browser/Dawn/PNG/timing receipt stays `not-run`.

The complete author → inspect → recover path is:

```ts
const renderer = (await createRenderer(canvas)).unwrap();
// Spawn DirectionalLight with a legal shadowFilter and PCSS units first.
const frame = renderer.draw(request);
if (!frame.ok) {
  // Read frame.error.code, .expected, .hint, and typed .detail.
  throw frame.error;
}
const shadow = renderer.inspect().directionalShadow;
// Repair the named owner, renderer.recover(), then retry request when needed.
void shadow;
```

The labels, units, defaults, structured error shape, and fallback vocabulary
are shared with [`@forgeax/engine-render`](../render/README.md); runtime owns
host assembly and recovery invocation, not a second Directional schema.

## Spot shadow inspection route

Author `SpotLight` beside its `Transform`, then use the renderer-owned channel
projection after `draw`; Runtime does not create a second light or shadow
registry. The render package has the complete authoring table and source
anchors in [Point and Spot shadow authoring → view inspection](../render/README.md#point-and-spot-shadow-authoring--view-inspection).

```ts
const channels = renderer.inspect().renderScene.gpuDriven.channels;
const spot = channels.filter((channel) => channel.viewPass === 'spot-shadow');
const point = channels.filter((channel) => channel.viewPass === 'point-shadow');
void spot; // viewIndex, lane, reason, and drawCount are bounded facts.
void point; // point views additionally expose face for cube-array inspection.
```

If a channel is `blocked`, follow its structured `failure.detail.owner` and
`failure.detail.recovery`; do not retry the candidate through CPU semantics or
infer ownership from an array position. Static `TextureAsset` cookies and
projectors follow the existing Catalog/resource route, while video and render
target sources remain dynamic semantic inputs.

## Render happy path

`createRenderer -> attach -> draw -> inspect/observe/recover` assembles one
`RenderScene -> Standard Pipeline -> DeviceScope -> FrameReceipt`
path. `draw` returns `Result.ok(FrameReceipt)` only after the host finishes and
submits the frame. Bind observation requests to that receipt; repair the owner
named by `error.detail`, rebuild or cold-cook its source, and retry.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Runtime is the sole public host-assembly entry for `createRenderer`. It selects browser/backend services, invokes render's internal construction seam, and cleans up partial construction. It does not own scene, skinning, animation, or render-domain APIs. The split-render source asset registry installs the same post-spawn joint resolver as the co-located renderer registry, so scene instantiation binds Skin joints before publication.

## Large instance lifecycle and recovery

Large layouts are authored through `Instances.transforms` in World or Scene
assets, independently of Runtime assembly and Renderer creation. World owns
the managed matrix array and publishes normal component changes; Render derives
its private persistent projection and GPU residency. Two Renderers can attach
the same World without creating or synchronizing separate authoring collections.

Read `renderer.inspect().instanceCollections` for accepted projection revision,
count, device generation, lane, upload ranges/bytes and structured failures.
The diagnostic collection ID is never saved into an asset. Repair author data
through World/Scene; repair capability or GPU failures through the named owner.

On device loss, `await renderer.recover()` prepares replacement resources from
retained CPU facts. The next draw observes any newer World edits. Unload and
component removal retire their projections; Renderer disposal leaves the World
intact. See the complete
[Instances contract](../render/README.md#world-owned-instances-and-cpu-bounds).

## Standard profile recovery

The host exposes one `forgeax::standard` profile. `lightCount` is one of
`1 | 32 | 256`, `renderPath` is `forward | deferred`, and local finite lights
are always prepared for the shared Cluster transport. Invalid profile input
returns `standard-profile-invalid` with `expected`, `hint`, and `detail`; the
failed transaction keeps the last-known-good profile and device generation.

## Point-shadow creation recipe

Point shadows stay discoverable through the App recipe while the renderer
remains the sole owner of atlas admission and frame facts. Install
`pointShadowPlugin()` beside the existing renderer provider, then preflight a
caster count and read the detached inspection after a successful frame:

```ts
import { pointShadowPlugin } from '@forgeax/engine/app';

// Include this in the same App/Worker plugin list as rendererPlugin(renderer).
const pointShadow = app.pluginContext.pointShadow;
const result = pointShadow?.admit(1);
if (result !== undefined && !result.ok) throw result.error;
const facts = pointShadow?.inspect();
void facts?.shadowed;
```

`admit()` returns a structured `PointShadowRecipeError` for missing
`storageBuffer`, an invalid request, or a count above the renderer's shared
`ShadowAtlas` capacity. A World without `PointLightShadow` is the real inactive
case; there is no pseudo-disabled mode. `inspect()` reports `requested`,
`admitted`, `shadowed`, occupancy, and capacity from the last submitted frame;
it is not a second shadow registry. Directional CSM remains the renderer's
separate global path, and Runtime does not create another provider or submit
path.

## Assemble producer features

The host receives a heterogeneous list of producer-owned
`RenderFeature<FrameData>` values through one `createRenderer` options bag.
Import the feature contract and render vocabulary from
`@forgeax/engine/render`; import only assembly from `@forgeax/engine/runtime`.

```ts
import { ok } from '@forgeax/engine/types';
import type { RenderFeature } from '@forgeax/engine/render';
import { createRenderer } from '@forgeax/engine/runtime';

type FrameData = { readonly visibleCount: number };
const feature = {
  identity: 'package.feature',
  extract: ({ owner }) => ok<FrameData>({ visibleCount: owner }),
  plan: (data, context) => {
    void data.visibleCount;
    void context;
    return ok({ work: [] });
  },
} satisfies RenderFeature<FrameData>;

const created = await createRenderer(canvas, { features: [feature] });
if (!created.ok) throw created.error;
const renderer = created.value;
```

`renderer.inspect()` is the machine-readable lifecycle
surface. Read `status` and `latestError?.code`; use `latestError?.hint` for
the next action. `failed` retries on the next frame, `disabled` is revisited
by `renderer.recover()`, and `disposed` is terminal. `dispose()` is
idempotent. Feature plans are fixed during host assembly; graph replacement and
last-known-good recovery stay inside the Standard host.

Prepared compute remains a render-owned projection: program reflection,
bindings, direct or indirect dispatch shape, and persistent GPU buffers become
typed graph accesses before encoding. Runtime does not open a compute pass,
submit a second command buffer, or infer fallback from a backend name. The
selected render lane must be compatible with `RhiCaps.compute`, storage, and
indirect capabilities before it reaches graph compilation.

Features are declared before host assembly. A producer returns a closed
`RenderFeaturePlan`; the host owns identity, capability, error, and lifecycle
state. The plan contains shared frame work and view-scoped work. One feature instance
receives the full view roster once, including low-frequency views holding their
previous picture. The Renderer prepares all scopes, records shared work and view
work, submits once, and delivers one accepted source acknowledgment. The plan
is the producer's execution declaration; see Render's
[feature ownership contract](../render/README.md#renderfeature-the-producer-seam-first-read-index).

## Asset producer readiness boundary

Runtime consumes the validated Catalog and Pack/DDC projection; it does not
make a source package ready. For a missing or failed asset, the host follows
`inspect` -> producer `rebuild` or `cold-cook` -> `verify` -> retry of the same
GUID. Branch on structured asset errors and evidence details, never on console
text or a guessed file suffix.

Importer registration, source plus Meta repair, DDC persistence, receipt
creation, and Catalog publication belong to the build or dev producer host.
`createRenderer` does not add a hidden importer registry or runtime source
fallback. This keeps browser startup, player bundles, and render assembly
outside the asset authoring and cooking boundary.

## Plan execution boundary

The producer plan is compiled into the active typed graph. It declares cooked
programs, bindings, buffers, logical targets, and draw/dispatch commands; the
host derives access and owns preparation, recording, recovery, and submit.
There is no producer-side prepared-resource store and no private encoder seam.
See the detailed render contract in [`packages/render/README.md`](../render/README.md)
and the producer contract in [`packages/vfx/README.md`](../vfx/README.md).

The four concepts stay separate: `RenderFeature` is a producer callback
contract, Standard Pipeline is the single host-owned frame policy, a
RenderGraph pass is a declared execution node, and a material pass is a
shader-facing asset pass. The feature API and its structured error model are documented by
[`@forgeax/engine/render`](../render/README.md); this README documents only
the runtime assembly boundary.

## Assemble a renderer

```ts
import { createRenderer } from '@forgeax/engine/runtime';

const created = await createRenderer(canvas);
if (!created.ok) return created.error;
const renderer = created.value;
const attached = renderer.attach(world);
if (!attached.ok) return attached.error;
return renderer.draw({
  leases: [attached.value],
  camera: { lease: attached.value },
  environment: { lease: attached.value },
});
```

`createRenderer(canvas, options?, bundler?)` reports environment failures through
its structured construction error. After construction, `attach`, `draw`,
`inspect`, `observe`, and `recover` remain receipt-bound and `dispose()` is
idempotent.

`CreateRendererOptions.captureReflectionFallbackReadback` forwards the explicit
Render pixel-diagnostic option unchanged. Its default is off; Runtime owns no
reflection readback or publication policy.

## GPU pass timing forwarding

`CreateRendererOptions.gpuPassTiming` is forwarded unchanged through the
existing renderer-options projection. Runtime does not request timestamp
features, create a timing session, retain RHI handles, inspect a pass catalog,
or change `ProfileCapture`. Use the Render-owned public route: opt in, keep the
`draw()` `FrameReceipt`, call `observe(receipt, { include: ['timings'] })`, and
branch on the four statuses and structured `code`/`hint`. The accepted bounded
contract and recovery path are documented in
[`packages/render/README.md`](../render/README.md).

Membership timing is a separate producer-specific capability. Its records are
not generic accepted GPU pass evidence and must not become a second runtime
owner or controller.

### Browser backend selection and diagnosis

The default browser path prefers native WebGPU and can retry through the
`wgpu`/WebGL2 downlevel backend. Consequently, a native-channel
`adapter-unavailable` error means only that `navigator.gpu.requestAdapter()` did
not produce an adapter; it is not a verdict that the machine cannot run the
game. A thrown `requestAdapter()` failure is reported separately as
`webgpu-runtime-error` with the original name/message in `detail.error`, while a
literal `null` remains `adapter-unavailable`.

Always diagnose the final structured error rather than matching the word
“WebGPU”. Inspect `.code`, `.expected`, `.hint`, and nested backend causes. Asset,
shader, Pack, permission-policy, and application bootstrap failures belong to
their own owners and must not be repaired by replacing ForgeaX with a second
Canvas renderer or by swallowing the entry-module exception.

## Import each domain from its owner

Game authors use the public `@forgeax/engine/<package-directory>` facades. The
physical package names in this table identify repository ownership for Runtime
source and package tests; they are not individual install requirements.

| Need | Canonical package | Example imports |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Transforms and hierarchy | public `@forgeax/engine/scene` (physical owner `@forgeax/engine-scene`) | `Transform`, `GlobalTransform`, `ChildOf`, `scenePlugin` |
| Joint binding | public `@forgeax/engine/skinning` (physical owner `@forgeax/engine-skinning`) | `Skin`, `resolveSkinJoints` |
| Graph playback | public `@forgeax/engine/animation` (physical owner `@forgeax/engine-animation`) | `AnimationPlayer`, `animationPlugin` |
| Render vocabulary and frame interpretation | public `@forgeax/engine/render` (physical owner `@forgeax/engine-render`) | `Camera`, `MeshFilter`, `MeshRenderer`, `DirectionalLight`, `Materials`, `Renderer` |

```ts
import { GlobalTransform, scenePlugin, Transform } from '@forgeax/engine/scene';
import { Skin } from '@forgeax/engine/skinning';
import { animationPlugin, AnimationPlayer } from '@forgeax/engine/animation';
import { Camera, DirectionalLight, Materials, MeshFilter, MeshRenderer } from '@forgeax/engine/render';

void [scenePlugin, Transform, GlobalTransform, Skin, animationPlugin, AnimationPlayer];
void [Camera, DirectionalLight, Materials, MeshFilter, MeshRenderer];
```

> [!NOTE]
> `@forgeax/engine-runtime` is not a compatibility barrel. Importing those domain tokens from runtime is unsupported; follow the focused package README for each domain's roster, errors, and setup.

## Boundary

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Scene["scene"] --> App["app host"]
  Skinning["skinning"] --> App
  Animation["animation"] --> App
  Render["render vocabulary and frame interpreter"] --> Runtime["runtime host assembly"]
  Runtime --> App
```

`@forgeax/engine-render` owns `Renderer`, `RendererOptions`, render components,
declarative feature plans, frame stages, and render errors. Runtime owns only
the concrete `createRenderer` host contract and `EngineEnvironmentError`; it
never re-exports the moved domain APIs.

### Render Worker source assembly

The internal `createPublicationAssets` assembly loads an AssetRegistry and
metadata-only ShaderRegistry without a GPU. App uses it for the source realm
of the explicit `render-worker` tier; the child uses the ordinary runtime
Renderer assembly and owns GPU resource lifetime. See the
[App execution contract](../app/README.md#execution-tiers).


### Planar water capture

Use the Render-owned `PlanarReflection` companion and existing RenderTarget
API; Runtime adds no capture loop or material registry. See
[the authoring and receipt contract](../render/README.md#planar-reflection-capture).
Preview's shoreline offers resolution and update interval controls. Acceptance
requires real capture pixels, opposite-half-space rejection, retained texture /
projection pairing and a water consumer in the same RHI Debug frame; a camera
matrix unit test alone is insufficient.


### Multi-camera composition

Use Render's `CameraView` companion on simultaneous split-screen, minimap or
RenderTarget cameras. Runtime assembles one Renderer/device; Render owns per-view
visibility, depth, post-processing and history, plus one feature host for shared
simulation, per-view projection and the outer submit transaction. Local World
and Engine Worker to Render Worker paths use this same pipeline. Low-frequency
views retain their picture while shared simulation advances. The
[CameraView contract](../render/README.md#multi-camera-viewports-and-composition)
defines coordinates, ordering, cadence, target publication and inspection.
