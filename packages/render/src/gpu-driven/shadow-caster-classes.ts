 * Splits shadow casters into a settled static class and a dynamic class.
 * Skinned and sprite casters are always dynamic. A rigid caster declared
 * `Mobility static` is static from the update it first appears (or gains the
 * declaration) in, skipping observation; a later change of that caster takes
 * the derived path below, so a broken promise still renders correctly. Every
 * caster present at the first update is the level and starts static; a later
 * created caster stays dynamic for one {@link SHADOW_CASTER_PROMOTE_WINDOW};
 * a changed caster stays dynamic until it has been unchanged for its settle
 * threshold ({@link SHADOW_CASTER_SETTLE_FRAMES}). Either then joins the static
 * class on the next window boundary. A caster that changes
 * again within one threshold of its promotion is a periodic mover: its
 * threshold doubles up to {@link SHADOW_CASTER_SETTLE_MAX}, and halves back
 * for every threshold it then stays static. When the scene cannot prove which
 * slots changed, every caster counts as changed. With capsule shadows on,
 * capsule-ready (always skinned, so dynamic) casters are dropped from the
 * directional dynamic class; other views keep them. A slot reused by another
 * caster since the previous update holds a created caster, not a changed one.
 * Unchanged classes keep their array identities so cached views stay hits.
